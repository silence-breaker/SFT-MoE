O-RAN.WG2.TS.A1GAP-R004-v05.02
4.1.2 
Role of A1 in the O-RAN architecture 
The Non-RT RIC function resides in the SMO layer as described in O-RAN Architecture Description [4]. that also handles 
deployment, configuration, and data collection from RAN nodes. 
In the SMO layer there also resides functions that handle AI/ML workflow, e.g. training and update of ML models, as well as 
functions for deployment of ML models and other applications as described in AI/ML workflow description and requirements  
[i.1]. 
The SMO Layer may also have access to data other than that available in the RAN network functions and this enrichment 
information can be used to enhance the RAN guidance and optimization functions. 
One purpose of the SMO layer is to optimize the RAN performance towards fulfilment of the SLAs in the RAN intent. The 
purpose of the A1 interface is to enable the Non-RT RIC function to provide policy-based guidance, support for AI/ML 
workflows, and enrichment information to the Near-RT RIC function so that the RAN can optimize e.g. RRM under certain 
conditions.

The E2 nodes in figure 4.1.2-1 refers to RAN nodes such as an O-CU-CP, an O-CU-UP, an O-DU or an O-eNB. A1 policies 
and A1 enrichment information derived from various (O-RAN internal and O-RAN external) sources, are provided by the 
Non-RT RIC to the Near-RT RIC via the A1 interface.

A1 service architecture 
4.1.3.1 
A1 policy management service (A1-P) 
The A1 policy management service (A1-P), and the policy related procedures listed in clause 6.2, are defined for 
communication between an A1-P service consumer referred to as A1-P Consumer and an A1-P service producer referred to as 
A1-P Producer. SMO/Non-RT RIC framework takes the role of A1-P Consumer and Near-RT RIC takes the role of A1-P 
Producer as illustrated in figure 4.1.3.1-1.

Figure 4.1.3.1-1: A1-P 
Based on high level goals for the system expressed in RAN intent, and on observables (events and counters) provided over O1, 
the Non-RT RIC can define policies that are provided to the Near-RT RIC over the A1 interface. The purpose of the A1 
policies is to guide the RAN performance towards the overall goal expressed in RAN intent. The A1 policies are declarative 
policies that contain statements on policy objectives and policy resources applicable to e.g. UEs and cells. 
The Non-RT RIC can manage the A1 policies based on A1 policy status and feedback information provided by the Near-RT 
RIC, and on the network status provided over O1. The Non-RT RIC can use the O1 observables to continuously evaluate the 
impact of the A1 policies towards fulfilment of the RAN intent and based on internal conditions it can decide to issue/update 
the goals expressed in the A1 policies. 
The Near-RT RIC functions based on its internal functions or applications, the configuration received over O1 and the 
temporary policies received over A1. The A1 policies may not survive a re-start of the Near-RT RIC.  
To support the policy enforcement in the Near-RT RIC, the Non-RT RIC can provide enrichment information over the A1 
interface. 
4.1.3.2 
A1 enrichment information service (A1-EI) 
The A1 enrichment information service (A1-EI), and the enrichment information transfer procedures listed in clause 6.3, are 
defined for communication between an A1-EI service consumer referred to as A1-EI Consumer and an A1-EI service producer 
referred to as A1-EI Producer. SMO/Non-RT RIC framework RIC takes the role of A1-EI Producer and Near-RT RIC takes 
the role of A1-P Consumer as illustrated in figure 4.1.3.2-1.

O-RAN.WG2.TS.A1GAP-R004-v05.02
Enrichment information is generically defined as information provided to an entity, in addition to the information that is 
generally available to it, in order to enhance the performance of its tasks. It can be produced based on information from one or 
more sources, e.g. by relaying, combining, refining or analysing information from the input source(s). 
In O-RAN Architecture Description [4] it is described that external systems can provide enrichment data to the SMO. This is 
referred to as "O-RAN external information sources" while the network functions in the RAN are examples of "O-RAN 
internal information sources". 
SMO can collect information from O-RAN internal and O-RAN external information sources. Based on this information, Non-
RT RIC can derive information that could be beneficial for both Non-RT RIC and/or Near-RT RIC internal functions or 
applications, e.g. an ML model, to improve its performance. 
In relation to the A1 interface, two types of enrichment information are distinguished: A1 enrichment information and external 
enrichment information. 
The A1 interface is used for discovery, request, and delivery of A1 enrichment information. 
The A1 interface is also used for the discovery of external enrichment information and the SMO / Non-RT RIC is responsible 
for the authentication of the source and the security of the direct connection. 
NOTE: 
The handling of direct connections, and discovery or delivery of external enrichment information involving the 
A1 interface is not defined in the present document. 
4.1.3.3 
A1 ML model management service (A1-ML) 
The A1 ML model management service (A1-ML), and the ML model related procedures listed in clause 6.4, are defined for 
communication between an A1-ML service consumer referred to as A1-ML Consumer and an A1-ML service producer 
referred to as A1-ML Producer. Depending on the use case, SMO/Non-RT RIC framework takes the role of A1-ML Producer 
and Near-RT RIC takes the role of A1-ML Consumer, or SMO/Non-RT RIC framework takes the role of A1-ML Consumer 
and Near-RT RIC takes the role of A1-ML Producer, as illustrated in figure 4.1.3.3-1.

4.2 
A1 interface general principles 
The general principles for the specification of the A1 interface are as follows: 
• 
the A1 interface is an open logical interface within O-RAN architecture between the Non-RT RIC functionality in 
the SMO and the Near-RT RIC functionality in the RAN; 


<!-- Page 10 -->

10 
 
O-RAN.WG2.TS.A1GAP-R004-v05.02
• 
the A1 interface enables a multi-vendor environment and is independent of specific implementations of the SMO, 
Non-RT RIC, and Near-RT RIC; 
• 
the A1 interface is defined in an extensible way that enables new services and data types to be added without 
needing to change the protocol stack or the procedures; 
• 
the A1 interface enables policy-based guidance (objective, resource) of radio resource management internal 
functions or applications that are part of Near-RT RIC; 
• 
the A1 interface enable mechanisms for Near-RT RIC to provide status and feedback information regarding 
enforcement of A1 policies to Non-RT RIC; 
• 
the policy enforcement service in Near-RT RIC requires that the policies transferred over A1 interface are 
expressed using a standardized mechanism (language, syntax, etc.); 
• 
the A1 interface enables transmission of A1 enrichment information from Non-RT RIC to Near-RT RIC as needed 
by Near-RT RIC; 
• 
the A1 interface enables Near-RT to discover available enrichment information for which secure delivery can be 
provided, and to request delivery of enrichment information; 
• 
A1 policies are created, modified, and deleted by the Non-RT RIC; 
• 
the A1 policies are enforced until deleted and it is the responsibility of Non-RT RIC to create and delete policies 
based on context information e.g. observability from RAN indicating RAN intent fulfilment received over O1;  
• 
EI jobs are created, modified, and deleted by the Near-RT RIC based on the needs of its internal functions; 
• 
the Non-RT RIC delivers A1 enrichment information to the Near-RT RIC according to an EI job as long as the EI 
job is enabled and until it is deleted; and 
• 
the A1 interface enables mechanisms for SMO/Non-RT RIC to exchange AI/ML model training related messages 
with Near-RT RIC. 
4.3 
A1 interface specification objectives 
The A1 interface specification facilitates the following: 
• 
inter-connection of Non-RT RIC functionality in the SMO with Near-RT RIC functionality in the Radio Access 
Network supplied by different manufacturers; 
• 
provision of policies for individual UEs or groups of UEs, or for individual cells or group of cells; 
• 
provision of status and feedback from Near-RT RIC that enables Non-RT RIC to monitor the enforcement of 
policies; 
• 
provision of enrichment information as requested by Near-RT RIC; and 
• 
exchange of AI/ML model training related messages between SMO/Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC. 
4.4 
A1 interface capabilities 
As described in Non-RT RIC & A1/R1 Interface: Use Cases and Requirements [2], the A1 interface supports: 
• 
transfer of policy management information from Non-RT RIC to Near-RT RIC; 
• 
policy status and feedback information from Near-RT RIC to Non-RT RIC; 
• 
discovery and request of A1 enrichment information from Near-RT RIC to Non-RT RIC and delivery of A1 
enrichment information from Non-RT RIC to Near-RT RIC; and

Near-RT RIC. 
As described in A1TP [8], clause 7, the A1 interface supports: 
•

Functions of the A1 interface

Policy management 
5.1.1 
Introduction 
The purpose of A1 policies is to enable the Non-RT RIC function in the SMO to guide the Near-RT RIC function, and hence 
the RAN, towards a better fulfilment of the RAN intent. 
NOTE: 
RAN intent represents e.g. the SLA from the BSS (Business Support System) that the RAN is to fulfil for all 
users or for a subset of users (e.g. QCI or slice). Based on the permanent configuration and the available 
resources, the RAN strives to deliver the expected QoS for the users. 
By utilising the observability over O1, and the A1 policy status and feedback information, the Non-RT RIC can conclude that 
the RAN intent is not achieved. The Non-RT RIC can then decide to use A1 policies that enable the Near-RT RIC to e.g. 
optimize RRM for a single UE or for a group of UEs. 
EXAMPLE: 
When the Non-RT RIC understands that the available resources in a certain area are not enough to fulfil 
the SLA for all users in a slice, it can then decide to temporarily change the QoS targets for some users 
(dynamic group of users) belonging to the same slice (pre-defined group of users). 
There are different types of A1 policies referred to as A1 policy types. A Non-RT RIC need not use all A1 policy types, and a 
specific function in the Near-RT RIC may only support one specific A1 policy type. Non-RT RIC can discover available A1 
policy types over the A1 interface. 
NOTE: 
As A1 policy types represent capabilities of the Near-RT RIC and they may also be indicated to the Non-RT RIC 
in other ways. 
5.1.2 
The policy management function 
The policy management function is used by the Non-RT RIC to provision and manage A1 policies in the Near-RT RIC. The 
Non-RT RIC is responsible for definition and administration of A1 policies. 
The function is used to query the available A1 policy types in the Near-RT RIC. 
The function is used to create, update, and delete A1 policies in the Near-RT RIC. 
The function is used to query the presence, content, and run-time status of an A1 policy in the Near-RT RIC.  
The function is supported by A1 policy status and feedback information from the Near-RT RIC to the Non-RT RIC.  
NOTE 1: As the Near-RT RIC cannot change the content of a policy, only a change in enforcement status can be notified. 
If context is changed in such a way that the enforcement status of a policy is changed, the Non-RT RIC is 
notified and may decide to delete the policy. 
NOTE 2: Feedback on the fulfilment of A1 policies in the Near-RT RIC is not transferred over the A1 interface. The Non-
RT RIC can estimate the fulfilment of A1 policies based on O1 observables. 
NOTE 3: Before and after the creation of an A1 policy, the Non-RT RIC can monitor the network to understand the effect 
of the A1 policy on performance. Performance monitoring or tracing is not handled over the A1 interface.

5.1.3 
Lifecycle aspects of A1 policies 
Per default, the Near-RT RIC controls the RAN based on the persistent configuration. The RAN operation can be optimized 
using A1 policies that, compared to the persistent configuration,  
• 
are not critical to traffic; 
• 
have temporary validity; 
• 
handle individual UE or dynamically defined groups of UEs; 
• 
express goals for the optimization rather than direct changes to the configuration; and 
• 
are non-persistent, i.e., do not survive a restart of the Near-RT RIC. 
An A1 policy exists in the Near-RT RIC after it has been created by the Non-RT RIC using the Create policy procedure and 
accepted by the Near-RT RIC.  
For an A1 policy, the Near-RT RIC can provide status and feedback information to the Non-RT RIC. 
The Near-RT RIC continuously evaluates the policy conditions versus the environment and notifies the Non-RT RIC in case 
the enforcement status of the policy changes due to e.g. environment changes. 
When a create A1 policy request is accepted, the Non-RT RIC can assume that the policy is enforced until policy status is 
queried or a change in enforcement status is notified. 
An A1 policy can be updated by the Non-RT RIC using the Update policy procedure. After the update, the policy is evaluated 
and enforced by the Near-RT RIC based on the updated policy statements. 
An A1 policy exists in the Near-RT RIC until it is deleted by the Non-RT RIC using the Delete policy procedure.  
The states related to policy lifecycle and policy enforcement are illustrated in figure 5.1.3-1.

Figure 5.1.3-1: State transition diagram for policy in the Non-RT RIC 
The state transition diagram in figure 5.1.3-1 illustrates the Non-RT RIC view of the states of a policy instance during the 
policy lifecycle. All state transitions are related to A1 policy related procedures as listed in clause 6.1 with the following notes:

NOTE 1: A Create policy request is accepted after the policy has been validated and considered as being possible to 
enforce. 
NOTE 2: An Update policy request is accepted after the policy has been validated and considered as being possible to 
enforce, it does not cause a state transition unless it makes a policy possible to enforce. 
NOTE 3: A Delete policy request, whether accepted or not, always leads to that the Non-RT RIC considers the policy as 
deleted.  
NOTE 4: A Query policy request does not cause a state transition, and a Query policy status request does not cause a state 
transition in case the enforcement status has not changed. 
NOTE 5: A Query policy request or a Notify policy status cause a state transition in case the enforcement status has 
changed from ENFORCED to NOT_ENFORCED. 
NOTE 6: A Query policy request or a Notify policy status cause a state transition in case the enforcement status has 
changed from NOT_ENFORCED to ENFORCED. 
5.1.4 
Identification and scope of A1 policies 
5.1.4.0 
General 
An A1 policy type is identified by the policy type identifier (PolicyTypeId). Different policy types have different 
PolicyTypeIds. Based on the PolicyTypeId, schemas are identified and used for creation, validation, and formulation, and for 
query of the status, of A1 policies of that type.  
An A1 policy is identified by a policy identifier (PolicyId) that shall be assigned by Non-RT RIC. The PolicyId shall be locally 
unique within Non-RT RIC and sent in the policy request operations that carry representations of A1 policies. 
A1 policies consist of a scope identifier and one or more policy statements as illustrated in figure 5.1.4.0-1. The scope 
identifier represents what the policy statements are to be applied on (e.g. UEs, QoS flows, or cells). The policy statements 
represent the goals to the Near-RT RIC and covers policy objectives and policy resources. 
Scope identifier
Policy statement(s)
A1 policy
 
Figure 5.1.4.0-1: Illustration of the structure of an A1 policy 
By including policy statements with policy objectives,  
• 
the quality of experience can be optimized for UEs or QoS flows that are identified either explicitly by e.g. a UE 
identifier or a QoS identifier, or implicitly by e.g. a group identifier from which the Near-RT RIC can deduce a set 
of UEs; and 
• 
energy saving can be applied to one or more cells that are identified either explicitly by e.g. a cell identifier or 
implicitly by e.g. a list of identifiers from which the Near-RT RIC can deduce a set of cells. 
By including policy statements with policy resources, UEs can e.g. be made to avoid certain cells or the radio network can be 
optimized in specific areas. 
The identifiers that can be used as scope identifier in A1 policies are defined as data types in the A1 Type Definitions 
specification [5], clause 6.3.1. The scope identifier can be composed by a single or a by a combination of these as defined for 
each policy type definition in A1TD [5], clause 7.2.

O-RAN.WG2.TS.A1GAP-R004-v05.02
5.1.4.1 
Identification of UEs 
In the scope of A1 policies, a UE is identified by a UE identifier. The UE identifier identifies a logical UE entity that is known 
to the RAN and measurements related to it. It does not identify any hardware equipment or user subscription. 
The UE identifier is used for correlating O1-PM data with service targets and enables evaluation of the fulfilment of policies. 
In order to be able to utilize non-RAN data for the usage of A1 policies, non-RAN data need to include identifiers that can be 
correlated with the UE identifier by the Non-RT RIC. 
If the Non-RT RIC needs to express policies for multiple individual UEs, it can be done through a set of policies, one for each 
individual UE.  
5.1.4.2 
Identification of groups of UEs 
In the scope of A1 policies, a group of UEs can be identified based on a group identifier. 
When the Near-RT RIC receives a group identifier in an A1 policy, it may resolve it into a set of UEs that are present in the 
nodes controlled by the Near-RT RIC and applies the policy statements to each one of the UEs.  
5.1.4.3 
Identification of slices 
When the Near-RT RIC receives a slice identifier in an A1 policy, it may resolve it into a set of UEs and a set of QoS flows 
that are present in the nodes controlled by the Near-RT RIC and applies the policy statements to each one of the UEs or the 
QoS flows. 
5.1.4.4 
Identification of QoS flows 
When the Near-RT RIC receives a QoS identifier in an A1 policy, it may resolve it into a set of QoS flows (that are related to 
the applications that the Non-RT RIC is intending to optimize) and the set of UEs (that are present in the nodes controlled by 
the Near-RT RIC) for which they apply. Then it applies the policy statements to each one of the UEs and QoS flows. 
5.1.4.5 
Identification of cells 
In the scope of A1 policies, a part of the radio network can be identified based on a cell identifier or a set of cell identifiers. 
When the scope identifier in an A1 policy contains one or more cell identifiers, the policy statement may contain policy 
resources and the policy may implicitly impact on multiple UEs handled by the specified cell(s). 
An A1 policy is applied to a specific cell when a cell identifier is included in the scope. An A1 policy is applied to a group of 
cells when a set of cell identifiers is included in the scope. When no cell identifier or set of cell identifiers is included in the 
scope, a policy may apply to multiple cells. 
If the Non-RT RIC needs to express policies for a group of cells (i.e. a set of cells), it is done through a set of policies for 
individual cells or through a set of cell identifiers or other identifiers that the Near-RT RIC may resolve into a set of cell 
identifiers. 
5.1.5 
A1 policy content 
5.1.5.1 
General 
In addition to a scope identifier, an A1 policy contains policy statements. There are several kinds of policy statements that 
cover policy objectives and policy resources. 
NOTE: 
The detailed rules for how to formulate policy statements, and which combinations of identifiers and statements 
that are allowed, are specified for the policy types defined in A1TD [5], clause 7.2.

O-RAN.WG2.TS.A1GAP-R004-v05.02
5.1.5.2 
Policy objectives 
A statement for policy objectives expresses the goal for the policy. It can be related to e.g. QoS or QoE targets, or KPI or KQI 
targets. For detailed definitions of statements for policy objectives, see A1TD [5], clause 6.3.3. 
There is normally only one statement for policy objectives in an A1 policy.  
5.1.5.3 
Policy resources 
A statement for policy resources expresses the conditions for resource usage for the policy. It can be related to e.g. cell 
preferences. For detailed definitions of statements for policy resources, see A1TD [5], clause 6.3.4. 
Statements for policy resources can be combined with a statement for policy objectives in an A1 policy.  
5.2 
A1 enrichment information 
5.2.1 
Introduction 
The purpose of A1 enrichment information is to enable the Near-RT RIC to improve its RAN optimization performance by 
utilizing information that is not available within the RAN. The information sources can be O-RAN internal and O-RAN 
external, and the derived A1 enrichment information can be provided by the Non-RT RIC over the A1 interface. 
There are different types of A1 enrichment information referred to as EI types. A Near-RT RIC may not need to use all EI 
types, and a specific function in the Near-RT RIC may only need one specific type of A1 enrichment information. 
An EI type is identified by the EI type identifier (EiTypeId). Based on the EiTypeId, information can be provided about the A1 
enrichment information properties and how to request delivery of the A1 enrichment information. 
The Near-RT RIC can discover available EiTypeIds over A1 and request delivery of A1 enrichment information related to an 
available EiTypeId. The Non-RT RIC controls the access to A1 enrichment information and how the connection for delivery of 
the enrichment information can be made. 
NOTE: 
There may be functions in the SMO or the Non-RT RIC that also utilize enrichment information for their tasks, it 
may be the same or different enrichment information as exposed over the A1 interface. This is outside the scope 
of the present document to describe. 
5.2.2 
The enrichment information function 
The enrichment information function is used by the Non-RT RIC to produce and make A1 enrichment information available to 
the Near-RT RIC. The Non-RT RIC is responsible for exposure and secure delivery of A1 enrichment information. 
The function is used to publish available EiTypeIds over A1. 
The function is used to deliver A1 enrichment information for an EiTypeId based on an EI job. 
5.2.3 
Lifecycle aspects of A1 enrichment information 
5.2.3.1 
Registration of enrichment information source 
Before the Non-RT RIC can provide a certain EiTypeId over A1, the SMO needs to set-up the collection of input information 
from O-RAN internal and/or external sources and the Non-RT RIC needs to set-up the functions that produce the enrichment 
information based on the input information and deliver it. When onboarding and set-up is complete, the new EiTypeId can be 
discovered over A1.

O-RAN.WG2.TS.A1GAP-R004-v05.02
5.2.3.2 
Discovery of enrichment information 
5.2.3.2.0 
General 
Before a Near-RT RIC can use A1 enrichment information it needs to identify that the needed EiTypeId is available and how 
to access it. 
The Near-RT RIC can discover available EiTypeIds using A1-EI. The Non-RT RIC controls which EiTypeIds are discoverable 
and accessible by a specific Near-RT RIC. 
For a specific EiTypeId, the Near-RT RIC can request a detailed description of the enrichment information provided and how 
to formulate a request for delivery of it. 
5.2.3.2.1 
Lifecycle aspects of EI types 
The Non-RT RIC is responsible for ensuring that the EI types that are discoverable over A1 can be used for EI jobs and 
delivery of EI job results. An EiTypeId shall not be made available until EI jobs can be created, and EI job results delivered for 
that EI type. 
In case Non-RT RIC detects that it is no longer able to deliver EI job results for an EI type, the EiTypeId should no longer be 
discoverable over A1. 
5.2.3.3 
Request and Delivery of enrichment information 
5.2.3.3.0 
General 
A1 enrichment information can be delivered to the Near-RT RIC in different ways depending on the type of the A1 enrichment 
information or on the needs from the using internal function or application. 
A1 enrichment information can be delivered on an as per needed basis, due to an event or continuously. For continuous 
delivery, different mechanisms can be used depending on the volume of enrichment information to be delivered.  
Following the discovery that an EiTypeId is available, the request and delivery of A1 enrichment information is done in two 
steps: 
1) 
First the Near-RT RIC requests over A1 to get A1 enrichment information for the EiTypeId by creating an EI job that 
contains a description of the information that is requested and which delivery mechanism to use. 
2) 
Then the Non-RT RIC sets up the appropriate connection and delivers A1 enrichment information according to the 
agreed details for the EI job. 
5.2.3.3.1 
Lifecycle aspects of EI jobs 
The Near-RT RIC can initiate creation, update, and deletion of EI jobs. The EI job is created when the Near-RT RIC needs A1 
enrichment information of a specific EI type and the EI job is deleted when the Near-RT RIC no longer needs the information. 
In case the Near-RT RIC temporarily cannot use delivered EI, it can discard or buffer the received EI or stop the EI delivery by 
deleting the EI job and re-create it when it is ready to receive delivered EI. 
The Near-RT RIC may query existing EI jobs after a re-start, and either delete, update, or keep the EI jobs if still relevant. 
5.2.3.3.2 
Lifecycle aspects of EI job results 
The Non-RT RIC is responsible for the set-up of connections to the Near-RT RIC for the delivery of EI job results according to 
the agreed EI job. The delivery of the EI job results is started when the EI job is created and stopped when the EI job is 
deleted.

17 
 
O-RAN.WG2.TS.A1GAP-R004-v05.02
In case delivery connections cannot be set-up to the Near-RT RIC, the Non-RT RIC need not buffer any information produced 
while the delivery connections are not successful. In case the EI cannot be successfully produced or delivered according to an 
agreed EI job, the Near-RT RIC can detect this through the delivered EI job results, or through lack of delivered EI job results. 
The Near-RT RIC may evaluate the received EI job results. If the received EI job results are not according to expectations, the 
Near-RT RIC can update the EI job or delete it.  
5.2.4 
Identification of A1 enrichment information 
A1 enrichment information is identified by the A1 enrichment information identifier (EiTypeId). Different types of A1 
enrichment information have different EiTypeIds.  
The Near-RT RIC can request delivery of A1 enrichment information from the Non-RT RIC by creating an EI job for an 
EiTypeId. The EI job and the EI job results are identified by an EI job identifier (EiJobId) assigned by the Near-RT RIC. 
5.2.5 
A1 enrichment information format and delivery 
5.2.5.1 
Push based delivery 
When A1 enrichment information has been produced during an EI job, it is pushed from the Non-RT RIC to the Near-RT RIC. 
This can be done once, regularly or event based depending on the conditions set for the EI job. 
5.3 
ML model management 
5.3.1 
Introduction 
The purpose of A1 ML model management is to enable: 
• 
the Near-RT RIC to request the Non-RT RIC to train an AI/ML model; 
• 
the Non-RT RIC to request the Near-RT RIC to train an AI/ML model; 
• 
the Near-RT RIC to query the training status of an AI/ML model that is trained at Non-RT RIC/SMO;
