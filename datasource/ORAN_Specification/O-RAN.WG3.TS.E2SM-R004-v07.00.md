Foreword 
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by WG3 of the O-RAN Alliance. 
The content of the present document is subject to continuing work within O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN 
approval. Should the O-RAN Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN with an 
identifying change of version date and an increase in version number as follows: 
version xx.yy.zz 
where: 
xx: the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. 
(the initial approved document will have xx=01).  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed. 
yy: the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document. Always 2 
digits with leading zero if needed. 
zz: 
the third digit-group included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the 
editing process. External versions never include the third digit-group.  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed. 
Modal verbs terminology 
In the present document "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "may", "need not", "will", "will not", "can" and 
"cannot" are to be interpreted as described in clause 3.2 of the O-RAN Drafting Rules (Verbal forms for the expression of 
provisions). 
"must" and "must not" are NOT allowed in O-RAN deliverables except when used in direct citation.

Common Information Elements for E2SM Service 
Models 
6.1 
General 
Clause 6.2 presents the individual Information Elements that may be adopted by any specific E2SM including the 
specifications listed in table 5-1. Clause 6.3 provides the corresponding ASN.1 definition of each Information Element, this 
module may be associated with the ASN.1 definitions in a specific E2SM specification using the ASN.1 "Import" instruction. 
The following attributes are used for the tabular description of the messages and information elements:  
NOTE: 
The messages have been defined in accordance with the guidelines specified in 3GPP TR 25.921 [i.2]. 
6.2 
Information Element definitions 
6.2.1 
General 
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the 
semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits: 
- 
The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the Most Significant Bit (MSB). 
- 
The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the Least Significant Bit (LSB). 
- 
When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the 
concerned information.

Clause 6.3.2 presents the Abstract Syntax of the common E2SM information elements that may be used with RAN Function

the ASN.1 definition in this clause and the tabular format in clause 6.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the 
definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
