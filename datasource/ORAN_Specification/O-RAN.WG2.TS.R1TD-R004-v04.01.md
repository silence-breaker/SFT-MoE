# Foreword

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by WG2 of the O-RAN
Alliance.

The content of the present document is subject to continuing work within
O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN
Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be
re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of version date and an
increase in version number as follows:

version xx.yy.zz

where:

xx: the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance,
i.e., technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial
approved document will have xx=01). Always 2 digits with leading zero if
needed.

yy: the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes
have been incorporated in the document. Always 2 digits with leading
zero if needed.

zz: the third digit-group included only in working versions of the
document indicating incremental changes during the editing process.
External versions never include the third digit-group. Always 2 digits
with leading zero if needed.

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in R1GAP
\[2\], R1AP \[1\], and the following apply:

**DME type**: data type managed and exposed by the DME services and
identified by a DME type identifier.

re-uses 3GPP data types where applicable.

## 3.2 Symbols

# 4 R1 Application data model

## 4.1 Introduction

The present document together with R1AP\[1\] defines the realization of
the R1 procedures defined in R1GAP \[2\] and R1UCR \[3\].

R1AP \[1\] contains the service description, service operations,
resource definition and the API definition (including the Open API
document) for the R1 services. The present document contains the data
model and the definitions of the schema-based objects transported in the
procedures defined for the R1 services.

The data types defined in the present document are API-independent and
are lifecycle independently from the APIs defined in R1AP \[1\].

## 4.2 Version conventions for the present document 

The version number of the present document follows the \"xx.yy\"
versioning scheme. There could be implications for the compatibility
between implementations that uses DME types defined in different
versions of this specification.

An incremented \"xx\" version field of the present document could
indicate that a new major feature (e.g., a new DME type) has been added,
removed or that an incompatible change has been made to one or more DME
types. An incremented \"yy\" version field could indicate that an
optional feature has been added, a technical issue has been fixed, or
that clarifications or editorial corrections have been made.

The compatibility of rApps and R1 service API implementations in
SMO/Non-RT RIC framework depends on the R1 service APIs and data types
that are implemented. The present document handles the versions for
protocol-agnostic data types used by the R1 services while the R1
service API versioning aspects are handled in R1AP \[1\].

# 5 Data type definitions for Data Management and Exposure services

## 5.1 Common definitions

### 5.1.1 Introduction

This clause provides common definitions applicable to multiple DME
types.

### 5.1.2 Identifiers and Metadata

#### 5.1.2.1 DME type identifier 

A DME type is identified by an identifier defined as dmeTypeId in R1AP
\[1\], clause B.4.2. The DME type identifier consists of a namespace,
name and a version.

#### 5.1.2.2 Data category 

A DME type shall be assigned to at least one data category. Assigned
data category values can be used as query parameter when searching for
available DME types as specified in R1AP \[1\] .

### 5.1.3 Versioning of DME types

When updating a DME type, the version in the DME type identifier (see
clause 5.1.2.1) is updated according to SemVer \[4\] to reflect its
compatibility with other DME types that have the same namespace and
name.

Two DME types with the same namespace and name are incompatible if the
major version digit in the version is different.

Two DME types are only considered to be identical if all three of their
attribute's namespace, name and version are identical.

The version in the DME type identifier includes a pre-release version
(e.g., "-alpha.1") if the definition of a DME type is under development.

### 5.1.4 Schemas for DME types

#### 5.1.4.1 General

The definition of a DME type is based on two schemas, a data production
schema and a data delivery schema.

#### 5.1.4.2 Data production schema

The data production schema defines the structure for how to formulate
parameters for the production of data instances of a DME type by a data
job or a data offer. A data production schema can be based on data types
defined in other specifications.

Table 5.1.4.2-1 defines the attributes of the data production schema.

#### 5.1.4.3 Data delivery schema

The data delivery schema defines the structure of the delivered content
resulting from the related data job or data offer. A data delivery
schema can be based on data types defined in other specifications The
data delivery schema type is defined in R1AP \[1\].

A DME type can be defined with one or more data delivery schemas each
based on different schema technologies such as for example JSON schema
\[6\] and XSD \[7\], \[8\], \[9\] and \[i.1\].

instances of a DME type can be produced by means of a data job or data
offer.

The definition of a DME type follows a template that includes but is not
limited to:

1)  the declaration of a DME type identifier,

2)  the assignment of a data category,

3)  the definition of the data types needed for the data production
    schema (in terms of data selector, target selector, timing and
    optionally further types) and the data delivery schema or schemas,

4)  the definition of the data production schema and data delivery
    schema or schemas.
