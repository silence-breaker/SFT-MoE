# 4 General Aspects

## 4.1 Reference Model for Y1 interface

As depicted in Figure 4.1-1, the O-RAN architecture \[1\] supports
authorized consumers, which may be O-RAN or 3GPP NFs, to request RAN
analytics information from Near-RT RIC via Y1 interface.

![](media/image2.png){width="1.413888888888889in" height="1.95in"}

Figure 4.1-1: Reference Model for Y1 interface

## 4.2 Y1 interface general principles

The general principles for the specification of the Y1 interface are as
follows:

\- The Y1 interface is an open logical interface that enables services
to be accessed by authorized consumers;

\- The Y1 interface enables a multi-vendor environment and is
independent of specific implementations of the Near-RT RIC;

\- The Y1 interface is defined in an extensible way that enables new
services and data types to be added without needing to change the
protocols or the procedures.

## 4.3 Y1 interface specification objectives

The Y1 interface shall support the following:

\- inter-connection of Near-RT RIC and Y1 consumers.

# 5 Y1 services and operations
