# Foreword {#foreword .list-paragraph}

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by WG2 of the O-RAN
Alliance. It is part of a TS-family covering the O-RAN WG2: R1 interface
specifications.

The content of the present document is subject to continuing work within
O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN
Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be
re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of version date and an
increase in version number as follows:

version xx.yy.zz

where:

xx: the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance,
i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial
approved document will have xx=01). Always 2 digits with leading zero if
needed.

yy: the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes
have been incorporated in the document. Always 2 digits with leading
zero if needed.

zz: the third digit-group included only in working versions of the
document indicating incremental changes during the editing process.
External versions never include the third digit-group. Always 2 digits
with leading zero if needed.

# Transport protocols for R1 Services

## 4.1 General

The R1 interface is defined between the rApps and the Non-RT RIC
framework, as defined in R1GAP \[11\].

# REST based protocol stack 

## 5.1 General

The layers of the protocol stack for the R1 interface are described in
the following chapters:

-   TCP \[2\] provides the communication service at the transport layer,

-   TLS \[10\] is used as specified in SPS \[13\], clause 4.2 to provide
    secure HTTP \[17\] \[18\] connections,

-   HTTP \[16\] \[17\] \[18\] is used as application-level protocol,

-   The data interchange layer constitutes the transport of documents in
    the JSON format \[8\].

Figure 5.1-1illustrates the REST based protocol stack for the R1
interface.

Figure 5.1-1: REST Based Protocol Stack for the R1 Interface

## 5.2 Network layer

As network layer at least one of IPv6 \[9\] or IPv4 \[1\] shall be
supported.

## 5.3 Transport layer 

TCP \[2\] shall be supported as transport protocol.

NOTE: When using TCP as the transport protocol, an HTTP connection is
mapped to a TCP connection.

## 5.4 Security 

The specification of security controls on the R1 interface in SRS
\[12\], clause 5.2.6.2 shall be followed.

These security controls refer to the detailed specification of the
support and use of TLS v1.2 and TLS v1.3 (IETF RFC 8446 \[10\]), and
OAuth2.0 \[14\] with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (IETF RFC 7519 \[15\]) in the
O-RAN TS SPS \[13\] .

## 5.5 Application

As application layer, HTTP/1.1 \[17\] shall be supported, and HTTP/2
\[18\] should be supported. The HTTP semantics as defined in IETF RFC
9110 \[16\] shall be supported.

HTTP over TLS (as defined in IETF RFC 9112 for HTTP/1.1 \[17\] and in
IETF RFC 9113 \[18\] for HTTP/2) shall be supported.

HTTP details such as use of standard headers, custom headers, error
codes, methods, URIs etc. will be specified in Application Protocols for
R1 Services.

The default TCP port numbers should be used for HTTP operation.

## 5.6 Data interchange

As a data interchange format, JSON \[8\] shall be supported.

# Kafka based protocol stack 

## 6.1 General

The Kafka based protocol stack for the R1 interface includes the
following layers:

-   TCP \[2\] provides the communication service at the transport layer,

-   TLS \[10\] is used to provide secure connections at the security
    layer,

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The Kafka Protocol Guide \[20\] is used at the application layer,

-   The data interchange layer constitutes the serialization format in
    which data are represented.

Figure 6.1-1 illustrates the Kafka based protocol stack for the R1
interface.

Figure 6.1-1: Kafka Based Protocol Stack for the R1 interface

## 6.2 Network layer

As network layer at least one of IPv6 \[9\] or Ipv4 \[1\] shall be
supported.

##  6.3 Transport layer 

TCP \[2\] shall be supported as defined in Kafka Protocol Guide \[20\].

## 6.4 Security 

The specification of security controls on the R1 interface in SRS
\[12\], clause 5.1.2.1 shall be followed.

## 6.5 Application

As application layer, Kafka Protocol Guide \[20\] version 3.0 or higher
shall be supported. The Kafka semantics are defined in the Kafka
Documentation \[i.1\].

R1 service procedures as defined in R1GAP \[11\] are mapped to the Kafka
protocol in R1AP \[19\] .

## 6.6 Data interchange

The Kafka based protocol stack for the R1 interface is agnostic to the
data serialization format.
