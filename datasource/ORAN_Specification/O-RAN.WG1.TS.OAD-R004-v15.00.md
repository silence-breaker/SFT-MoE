This clause contains the general O-RAN architecture principles as
described below.

-   The O-RAN architecture, interface specifications, and terminology
    shall be consistent with 3GPP architecture, interface
    specifications, and terminology with additions to accommodate O-RAN
    specific features.

-   This document represents the O-RAN architecture at the time of its
    publication and may evolve as deemed appropriate by the O-RAN
    ALLIANCE.

-   The O-RAN architecture includes a logical representation of a Radio
    Access Network (RAN) which extends the 3GPP specified RAN and
    consists of logical NFs or logical nodes (as per 3GPP TS 38.300
    \[8\] and TR 21.905 \[i.1\]).

> NOTE: Therefore, the terms O-RAN NFs as well as O-RAN nodes are used
> interchangeably to refer to some of the logical O-RAN entities,
> according to the context used in that particular statement. In any
> case, they always refer to a logical entity and not to a physical or
> cloudified instantiation of an O-RAN NF or an O-RAN node.

# 5 O-RAN architecture

## 5.1 Overall architecture of O-RAN

Figure 5.1‑1 below provides a high-level view of the O-RAN architecture.
It shows that the interfaces -- A1, O1, Open Fronthaul M-plane and O2 --
connecting SMO (Service Management and Orchestration) framework to O-RAN
Network Functions and to O-Cloud. As depicted in this figure, the
O-Cloud includes the O-Cloud Notification interface as specified in
O-Cloud Notification API Specification for Event Consumers \[28\] is
available for the relevant O-RAN Network Functions (i.e., Near-RT RIC,
O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU) to receive O-Cloud related notifications.

Figure 5.1‑1 below also illustrates that the O-RAN Network Functions can
be hosted on the O-Cloud or on customized hardware.

All O-RAN NFs, except O-RU, are managed via the O1 interface to an
authorized SMO framework.

The O1 interface exposes management services for the O-RAN NFs that are
managed individually or together, as specified in OAM
Architecture\[34\].

The Open Fronthaul M-plane interface, between SMO and O-RU, supports the
O-RU management in hybrid mode, as specified in Open FH M-Plane \[24\].

O-RAN NFs instantiated on the O-Cloud may utilize the APIs exposed by
the Accelerator Abstraction Layer (AAL) defined in AALGAP \[29\].

The Near-RT RIC O-RAN NF in figure below provides RAN analytics
information services via the Y1 service interface as specified in Y1GAP
\[39\]. These services can be consumed by Y1 consumers after mutual
authentication and authorization by subscribing to or requesting the RAN
analytics information via the Y1 service interface. Y1 consumers role
can be played by entities which are within an PLMN trusted domain. Y1
consumers outside the PLMN trusted domain may use Y1 services in a
secure manner via an exposure function, e.g., as in 3GPP TS 23.501
\[1\], clause 5.20. The framework for mutual authentication and
authorization between Y1 consumers and the Near-RT RIC is not supported
in the present document.

Figure 5.1‑1: High Level Architecture of O-RAN

Within the logical architecture of O-RAN, as shown in Figure 5.1‑2
below, the radio side includes Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and
O-RU O-RAN NFs. The E2 interface connects O-eNB to Near-RT RIC. Although
not shown in this figure, the O-eNB does support O-DU and O-RU O-RAN NFs
with an Open Fronthaul interface between them. The Near-RT RIC, in the
figure below, supports the Y1 service interface towards Y1 consumers. Y1
consumers, unlike the other network elements shown in this figure, does
not denote a logical O-RAN function.

As stated earlier, the management side includes SMO Framework containing
a Non-RT-RIC function. The O-Cloud, on the other hand, is a cloud
computing platform comprising a collection of physical infrastructure
nodes that meet O-RAN requirements to host the relevant O-RAN NFs (such
as Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, and O-DU etc.), the supporting
software components (such as Operating System, Virtual Machine Monitor,
Container Runtime, etc.) and the appropriate management and
orchestration functions. The virtualization of O-RU is not supported in
the present document.

As shown in this figure, the O-RU provides the Open Fronthaul M-Plane
interface to authorized O-DU in hierarchical mode, or to authorized O-DU
and SMO in hybrid mode as specified in Open FH M-Plane \[24\] and OAM
Architecture \[34\].

> NOTE: The LLS (O-DU to O-RU interface) specified in clauses 5.3.5 and
> 5.3.6 (Split Option 7-2x) is the Open Fronthaul interface described in
> the Open FH CUS-Plane \[19\]. Other LLS options specified in 3GPP TR
> 38.801 \[i.2\] may be considered for reference designs when the
> relevant interfaces are described in specifications created by related
> open industry initiatives (e.g., the Small Cell Forum for Split Option
> 6) or in O-RAN white-box hardware specifications (e.g., Split Option
> 8).

As shown in Figure 5.1‑2, O-DU provides D2 interface to connect with
peer O-DU for supporting inter O-DU carrier aggregation. The D2
interface includes D2-u and D2-c services.

Figure 5.1‑2: Logical Architecture of O-RAN

The following figure shows the Uu interface between UE and O-RAN NFs as
well as between UE and O-eNB. As shown in Figure 5.1‑3 below, the dotted
box denotes all the O-RAN NFs required to support the Uu interface for
NR. The O-eNB, on the other hand, terminates the Uu interface for LTE.
Please refer to clause 5.4.17 for more details.

## 5.2 O-RAN control loops

The O-RAN architecture supports at least the following control loops
involving different O-RAN functionalities:

-   Non-RT (Non-Real Time) control loops

-   Near-RT (Near-Real Time) control loops

-   RT (Real Time) control loops

![](media/image5.png){width="6.407264873140857in"
height="3.098946850393701in"}

Figure 5.2‑1: O-RAN Control Loops

As shown in Figure 5.2‑1 above, the control loops are defined based on
the controlling entity and the architecture shows the other logical
entities with which the control loop host interacts.

Control loops exist at various levels and run simultaneously. Depending
on the use case, they may or may not interact with each other. The use
cases for the Non-RT and Near-RT control loops and the interaction
between the RICs for these use cases are fully defined by O-RAN Use
Cases Detailed Specification \[38\]. The Use Cases Detailed
Specification \[38\] also defines relevant interaction for the O-CU-CP
and O-DU control loops, responsible for call control and mobility, radio
scheduling, HARQ, beamforming etc. along with slower mechanisms
involving SMO management interfaces.\
The timing of these control loops is use case dependent. Typical
execution time for use cases involving the Non-RT control loops are 1
second or more; Near-RT control loops are in the order of 10
milliseconds or more; control loops in the E2 Nodes can operate below 10
milliseconds. (e.g., O-DU radio scheduling).

For any specific use case, however, a stable solution would require the
loop time in the Non-RT RIC and/or SMO management plane processes to be
significantly longer than the loop time for the same use case in the
control entities stated above.

## 5.3 Description of O-RAN architecture elements

### 5.3.1 Service Management and Orchestration framework

#### 5.3.1.1 Service Management and Orchestration framework architecture principles

Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) and Service Management and
Orchestration framework (SMO framework) have been used interchangeably
in this document.

Service Based Architecture (SBA) introduces the roles of service
producer and service consumer together with standardized service-based
interfaces. These standardized service-based interfaces enable
interoperability within the SMO. SBA is not concerned with the
implementation, but it defines logical functions in their service
producer and consumer roles. When properly applied the SBA approach can
enable the following:

-   Validates produced services with consumer use cases.

-   Identifies service operations with their information model defining
    semantic behaviour.

-   Specifies the API and a data model for a syntactic interface.

-   Identifies common services that can be produced by a single producer
    such as those that are commonly used by multiple internal consumers
    (e.g., authentication, authorization, service registration and
    discovery, data management, etc.).

#### 5.3.1.2 SMO Services (SMOSs)

##### 5.3.1.2.1 Introduction to SMO Services

In the O-RAN architecture, SMO is responsible for RAN domain management.
The SMO description in this architecture document is focused on the SMO
services that support the RAN. Following the SBA principles above, the
SMO Services produced by the SMO are defined. A SMOF implementation can
produce and/or consume any combinations of one or more SMOSs, provided
that the SMOF complies with the O-RAN specifications of the interfaces
exposing the SMOSs.

The Non-RT RIC SMOF example depicted in the Figure 5.3‑1 below shows
support for rApps and for A1 related SMOSs. Otherwise, the definition of
SMOFs is in general not in scope of the O-RAN specifications, as the
interoperable functional behaviour of SMOFs is specified via the SMOS
Producer/Consumer roles.

The SMO Services produced by the SMO are:

-   RAN NF OAM SMO Service specified in 3GPP TS 32.101 \[3\], including
    capabilities such as,

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   RAN NF Performance Assurance Management (NFPM)

-   RAN NF Fault Supervision Management (NFFM)

-   RAN NF Provisioning Management (NFCM)

-   Others, e.g., Tracing, Logging, etc.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Network Functions Orchestration (NFO) SMOS

-   Federated O-Cloud Orchestration and Management (FOCOM) SMOS

-   Service Management and Exposure (SME) SMOS

-   Data Management and Exposure (DME) SMOS

-   Topology Exposure and Inventory Management (TE&IV) SMOS

-   RAN Analytics SMOS

-   Service and Slice Subnet Orchestration SMOS

-   Service and Slice Subnet Assurance SMOS

-   AI/ML workflow (AIMLWF) SMOS

-   rApp Management SMOS

-   A1 related SMOSs

-   Software package onboarding SMOS

-   Policy Management and Information (PMI).

SME SMOS supports the exposure of other SMOSs, to both internal and
external SMOS consumers.

DME SMOS supports the exposure of data produced by SMOS Producers, to
both internal and external SMOS consumers.

The SMOSs described in this document are represented in a service-based
architecture in the Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1 below.

![](media/image6.png){width="6.849985783027122in"
height="3.763888888888889in"}

Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1: SMOSs in the SMO SBA representation

The SMOS Communication, shown in Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1, represents the
logical support for communication between any SMOS Producer, SMOS
Consumer, and rApps. Examples of SMOS Communication implementation
include, but are not limited to, service mesh, API gateway, direct
communicatio­n, and message bus. SMOS consumers and producers rely on
the capabilities provided by SME for purposes such as service discovery
and on the capabilities provided by DME for purposes such as data
exposure.

The R1 interface, shown in Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1, is a service-based
interface. R1 termination, also shown in Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1, enables R1
service producers and R1 service consumers to exchange messages via the
R1 interface.

Support for external service and/or data consumers and/or producers is
defined in clause 5.3.1.2.5.

##### 5.3.1.2.2 Service Management and Orchestration framework in the O-RAN architecture

All the SMO Service producers represented in Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1 can also
be SMOS consumers.

The SMO consumes services offered by other O-RAN architecture elements
through four key southbound interfaces:

-   A1 Interface between the Non-RT RIC in the SMO and the Near-RT RIC
    for RAN Optimization.

-   O1 Interface provides SMO FCAPS support either directly or
    indirectly between the SMO and the O-RAN Network Functions.

-   In the hierarchical model, SMO FCAPS support information over O1 to
    the O-DU which uses the Open FH M-Plane interface to manage the
    O-RU.

-   In the hybrid model, SMO provides FCAPS support information over
    Open FH M-Plane interface between the SMO and the O-RU and over O1
    to the O-DU which uses the Open FH M-Plane interface to manage the
    O-RU.

-   O2 Interface between the SMO and the O-Cloud to provide O-Cloud
    resource management and workload management.

##### 5.3.1.2.3 Non-RT RIC

Non-RT RIC is the functionality internal to the SMO that supports
intelligent RAN optimization by:

-   enabling an A1-related SMOS to provide policy-based guidance over
    the A1 interface

-   enabling an A1-related SMOS to provide enrichment information over
    the A1 interface

-   enabling an A1-related SMOS to provide ML model management over the
    A1 interface

-   enabling RAN optimization actions through RAN NF OAM SMOS over O1
    and Open FH M-Plane interfaces, and NFO and FOCOM SMOSs over O2
    interface

The rApps can be producers and/or consumers of R1 services, as shown in
Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1. For more information on R1 services and the R1
interface refer to Non-RT RIC Architecture \[27\].

Non-RT RIC supports intelligent RAN optimization control loops through
rApps with intervals greater than 1 second.

##### 5.3.1.2.4 SMO capabilities extensions 

As a flexible extension mechanism, the SMO allows delivery of aspects of
RAN management and orchestration functionality via rApps.

##### 5.3.1.2.5 Support for external service/data producers and/or consumers

SME and DME support the exposure of SMO services and/or data to
authorized external service and/or data consumers, as represented in the
SBA approach depicted in Figure 5.3.1.2.5‑1.

SME and DME support the consumption by SMO of services and/or data from
authorized external service and/or data producers, as represented in the
SBA approach depicted in Figure 5.3.1.2.5‑1.

consumers**

### 5.3.2 Near-RT RIC

Near-RT RIC is an O-RAN NF that enables near real-time control and
optimization of services and resources of E2 Nodes via fine-grained data
collection and actions over the E2 interface with control loops in the
order of 10 ms-1s. The Near-RT RIC hosts one or more xApps that use E2
interface to collect near real-time information (e.g., on a UE basis or
a Cell basis) and provide value added services. The Near-RT RIC control
over the E2 Nodes is steered via the policies and the enrichment data
provided via A1 from the Non-RT RIC. Based on the available data, the
Near-RT RIC generates the RAN analytics information and exposes it via
Y1 interface.

The functional enhancement provided by the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node
is subject to the capability of the E2 Node exposed over the E2
interface by means of the E2SM \[25\], in order to support the use cases
described in Use Cases Detailed Specification \[38\]. The E2 service
model describes the functions in the E2 Node which may be controlled by
the Near-RT RIC and the related procedures. For a function exposed in
the E2SM \[25\], the Near-RT RIC may e.g., monitor, override, or control
via policies the behavior of E2 Node.

In the event of a Near-RT RIC failure, the E2 Node shall be able to
provide services but there may be an impact to certain optimization
capabilities that are provided by the Near-RT RIC.

The Near-RT RIC is composed of a Near-RT RIC platform and one or more
xApps as specified in Near-RT RIC Architecture \[26\] and their
capabilities are exposed as services. Both the Near-RT RIC platform and
an xApp can be a service producer and/or a service consumer, and these
services can be accessed via the set of Near-RT RIC APIs as illustrated
in Figure 5.3.2‑1.

### 5.4.17 Uu interface

The UE to eNB/gNB interface in 3GPP is denoted as the Uu interface. The
Uu is a complete protocol stack from L1 to L3 and as such, seen as a
whole, it terminates in the NG-RAN. If the NG-RAN is decomposed,
different protocols terminate at different reference points and none of
them has been defined by O-RAN. Since the Uu messages still flow from
the UE to the intended eNB/gNB managed function, it is not shown in the
O-RAN architecture as a separate interface to a specific managed
function. For more information on the Uu interface between the UE and
the NG-RAN, please refer to clauses 5.2 and 5.3 of 3GPP TS 38.401

O-CU-CP. O-CU-UP for both the O-DUs can be same or different. One O-DU
can be connected to multiple O-DUs. D2 interface is used for supporting
inter O-DU NR carrier aggregation across O-DUs. An O-DU can be a PCell
O-DU for a particular UE and a SCell O-DU for another UE at the same
time.

## 5.5 UE associated identifiers used in O-RAN

As described earlier (clauses 5.3.1 and 5.3.2), the Non-RT RIC and
Near-RT RIC enable intelligent RAN optimization via A1, O1 and E2
interfaces respectively.

To support intelligent RAN optimization, the Non-RT RIC with rApps and
Near-RT RIC with xApps utilize the knowledge of different UE associated
events reported by the O-RAN NFs (excluding O-RU) over E2 and O1
interfaces. Both the Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC may need to correlate
different UE associated events reported by the O-RAN functions for the
same UE. In order to facilitate this correlation task, the reporting
O-RAN NF includes a set of UE associated identifiers with any report
containing UE specific information.

The Table 5.5‑1 below shows the set of UE associated identifiers to be
reported by any O-RAN NF (excluding O-RU) over O1 and E2 interfaces for
any UE associated information.

UE in the O-RAN NFs.

## 5.6 O-RAN security architecture

The goals of the O-RAN ALLIANCE are to achieve a secure, open, and
interoperable RAN. Building upon security advancements from the 3GPP and
IETF standards development organizations, the O-RAN ALLIANCE specifies
an O-RAN security architecture with the goal to enable 5G CSPs
(Communication Service Provider) to deploy and operate O-RAN with the
same, or higher level of confidence as a 3GPP-specified RAN. The O-RAN
ALLIANCE is strengthening O-RAN's security posture by specifying
security requirements and security controls that mitigate risk across
its attack surface while pursuing the goals of a ZTA (Zero-Trust
Architecture).

The O-RAN security architecture is specified in the following two O-RAN
Technical Specifications:

-   Security Protocols Specifications \[36\]

-   Security Requirements and Controls Specifications \[37\]

The above TSs, Security Protocols Specifications \[36\] and Security
Requirements and Controls Specifications \[37\], include specifications
for configuration and cipher suites with use of the following security
protocols on O-RAN interfaces to ensure confidentiality, integrity,
availability, and authenticity: SSHv2 (Secure Shell 2.0), TLS 1.2 and
1.3, DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) 1.2, IPsec (Internet
Protocol Security), OAuth 2.0, CMPv2, IEEE 802.1X, and NETCONF (Network
Configuration Protocol) over Secure Transport.

O-RAN has also provided requirements for SBOM (Software Bill of
Materials) in Security Requirements and Controls Specifications \[37\].

The test cases to verify proper security implementation of O-RAN
security architecture is specified in the O-RAN Technical Specification:

-   O-RAN Security Tests Specifications \[32\]

The threats to the O-RAN architecture and the risk assessment are
documented in the TR:

-   O-RAN Security Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment \[i.4\]

The security threat modeling and risk analysis is used to derive the
security requirements and security controls in the Security Requirements
and Controls Specifications \[37\]. The O-RAN Security Threat Modeling
and Risk Assessment \[i.4\] considers external and internal threats to
achieve a ZTA. In addition, security analysis TRs are maintained for
O-RAN NFs and features. These TRs help to drive the requirements in the
O-RAN security specifications.

> NOTE: Internal and external threats are considered in a ZTA, as
> defined in NIST SP 800-207 \[i.6\]. Achieving a ZTA is an incremental
> process, as identified by the United States Department of Homeland
> Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in Zero
> Trust Maturity Model \[i.7\]. The O-RAN ALLIANCE is continuing to
> pursue a ZTA as the O-RAN architecture, threats, and controls evolve.

# 6 O-RAN Information Model (IM) principles

O-RAN shall align its Information Model (IM) with 3GPP to the extent
possible. The additional O-RAN extensions to its IM and DMs (Data Model)
are described in O-RAN Information Model and Data Models Specification
\[30\].

######## Annex (informative): Implementation options of O-RAN functions and nework elements

## A.1 Shared cell

Shared cell, as specified in Open FH CUS-Plane \[19\], is defined as the
operation for the same cell by several O-RUs with one or multiple
component carriers. It can be deployed in either FHM (Fronthaul
Multiplexer) or Cascade mode as described below.

In FHM mode, the shared cell may be realized by placing an FHM function
between an O-DU and several O-RUs that may have one or multiple
component carriers from these O-RUs. FHM function may be modelled as an
O-RU with LLS Fronthaul support (same as normal O-RU) along with the
copy and combine function (additional to normal O-RU), but without radio
transmission/reception capability. The Figure A.1-1 below shows how each
O-RU can be used for either operating in the same cell (Single Cell
Scenario) or in different cells (Multiple Cells Scenario) by configuring
the FHM function.

height="2.9972615923009625in"}

Figure A.1-1: Shared cell deployment using FHM mode

In Cascade mode, the shared cell is realized by several O-RUs cascaded
in chain. In this case, one or more O-RUs are inserted between the O-DU
and the O-RU. The O-RUs in the cascaded chain except for the last O-RU
support Copy and Combine function. Figure A.1-2 below shows an
implementation of Cascade mode shared cell.

The Cascade mode, as described above, is implemented within the O-RU.

Please refer to Open FH CUS-Plane \[19\] for additional information.

## A.2 FHGW function

The FHGW (Fronthaul Gateway) function may be placed between the O-DU and
RU/RRU (Radio Unit / Remote Radio Unit) with the following O-RAN
specified interfaces:

-   The interface between O-DU and FHGW function is Open Fronthaul
    (Option 7-2x).

-   The interface between FHGW function and RU/RRU is subject to
    reference implementation developed by any relevant O-RAN WG (e.g.,
    WG7) as described in Hardware Reference Design Specification for
    Indoor Picocell (FR1) with Split Architecture Option 8 \[23\].

-   The interface between FHGW function and RU/RRU does not support Open
    Fronthaul (Option 7-2x).

-   The FHGW function may be packaged with other functions (such as
    Ethernet switching) in a physical product, as considered within WG7.

The Figure A.2-1 below depicts the deployment of the FHGW function using
O-RAN specified interfaces.

## A.4 Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU

Although the O-RAN architecture specifies the O-RAN NFs Near-RT RIC,
O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU as separate O-RAN architecture elements,
it is possible in the implementation to aggreagate some or all of these
O-RAN NFs, and thus collapsing some of the internal interfaces, e.g.,
F1-c, F1-u, E1, and E2. At least the following implementation options
are possible:

-   Disaggregated O-RAN NFs as per O-RAN architecture

-   Aggregate O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP

-   Aggregate O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, and O-DU

-   Aggregate Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, and O-CU-UP

-   Aggregate O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU

-   Aggregate O-DU and O-RU

-   Aggregate Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU

Aggregation of O-RAN NFs is supported by the O-RAN specified interfaces
O1 and E2. For the O1 interface, the aggregated O-RAN NFs will be
managed as separate Managed Functions belonging to a single Managed
Element as specified in OAM Architecture \[34\]. For the E2 interface
the aggregated O-RAN NFs can be exposed as part of the E2 Service Model
towards the Near-RT RIC (see Annex A in E2GAP \[22\]).

Please see the figures (i.e., Figure A.4-1 through Figure A.4-7) below.

## A.5 Cooperative transport

To enhance the resource utilization and reduce the latency of UL LLS
traffic when using a shared point-to-multipoint transport network
requiring resource allocation (such as PON or DOCSIS), the O-RAN
architecture supports a cooperative transport feature. The cooperative
transport feature is based on the O-DU's knowledge of the expected
uplink LLS traffic from a given O-RU which is provided to the associated
(PON or DOCSIS) TN in the transport network. This enables the TN to
dynamically allocate the correct bandwidth over the shared transport
network to the TU that is used by the O-RU. The CTI signaling is
described in CTI Control \[20\]. To support the CTI, the O-DU is
configured over the O1 interface with CTI client specific configuration
as described in CTI Management \[21\]. When there are intermediate nodes
between the O-DU and the TN, they will forward the CTI messages
transparently but will not participate in CTI interactions.

A simplified architecture of the CTI is shown in figure A.5-1 below. The
SMO, O-DU and O1 interface shown in this figure are part of the O-RAN
Architecture (please see clauses 5.3.1, 5.3.5, and 5.4.3, respectively),
whereas the TN and Transport OAM, are the components of the transport
network. For detailed specification and reference architecture, please
see CTI Control \[20\] and CTI Management \[21\].

## A.6 Inter O-DU Carrier Aggregation (CA)

The D2 interface is used for supporting carrier aggregation across cells
configured in the different O-DUs as specified in D2GAP \[40\]. In the
present document, DL CA is supported by the D2 interface that includes
D2-c and D2-u.
