# Foreword

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by WG7 of the O-RAN
Alliance.

The content of the present document is subject to continuing work within
O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN
Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be
re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of version date and an
increase in version number as follows:

version xx.yy.zz

where:

xx: the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance,
i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial
approved document will have xx=01). Always 2 digits with leading zero if
needed.

yy: the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes
have been incorporated in the document. Always 2 digits with leading
zero if needed.

zz: the third digit-group included only in working versions of the
document indicating incremental changes during the editing process.
External versions never include the third digit-group. Always 2 digits
with leading zero if needed.

# Modal verbs terminology

\"**should**\", \"**should not**\", \"**may**\", \"**need not**\",
\"**will**\", \"**will not**\", \"**can**\" and \"**cannot**\" are to be
interpreted as described in clause 3.2 of the O-RAN Drafting Rules

# 1 Scope

The present document specifies the test methods for Indoor Pico Cell. It
determines whether a WG7 White box hardware reference design conforms
with its requirements as specified in its Hardware Architecture and
Requirement specification (HAR).

In the main body of this specification (in any "chapter") the
information contained therein is informative.

It is noted that additional test cases may be required for a
comprehensive testing, which will be considered in the future version of
this document.

# 3 Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations

## 3.1 Terms

For the purposes of the present document, the terms \[given in \[i.1\]
and the following\] apply:

> **Carrier Frequency**: Center frequency of the cell.
>
> **F1 interface**: The open interface between O-CU and O-DU defined by
> 3GPP TS 38.473.
>
> **Frequency Band**: A designated frequency range for the operation of
> the base station and the UE radios. 5G NR frequency bands are divided
> into two different frequency ranges: Frequency Range 1 (FR1) that
> mainly includes sub-6GHz frequency bands, some of which are bands
> traditionally used by previous standards but has been extended to
> cover potential new spectrum offerings from 410MHz to 7125MHz;
> Frequency Range 2 (FR2) that includes frequency bands from 24.25 GHz
> to 52.6 GHz. Bands in this millimeter wave range have shorter range
> but higher available bandwidth than bands in the FR1.
>
> **Frequency Range**: It refers to bandwidth defined by the frequency
> range within which the Base Station can be operated, defined by the
> band-pass filter of the BS; e.g., 3.4 -- 3.8 GHz (400 MHz).
>
> **Occupied Bandwidth (OBW)**: It refers to the bandwidth occupied by
> the base station when operated, defined by the sum of the active
> bandwidths of the band allocation(s) operated. As defined by 3GPP TS
> 34.121 section 5.8, occupied bandwidth is the bandwidth containing 99%
> of the total integrated power of the transmitted spectrum, centered on
> the assigned channel frequency. The bandwidth between the 0.5% power
> frequency points is the occupied bandwidth.
>
> **Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW)**: It refers to the bandwidth in which
> all frequency components can be simultaneously analyzed. It is defined
> by the frequency boundaries of the operating band(s).
>
> **Fronthaul Gateway (FHGW)**: A fronthaul gateway is a physical entity
> that is located between a distributed unit and one or more radio units
> where it distributes, aggregates, and/or converts fronthaul protocols
> between the distributed unit and multiple radio units.
>
> **gNB**: A RAN node providing NR user plane and control plane protocol
> terminations towards the UE, and connected via the NG interface to the
> 5GC

## 6.6 Power consumption

The O-RU power consumption test is completed using the RF test
environment.

For the O-RU device under test that is powered by PoE or optical fiber
with integrated power cable, the network cable or composite cable with
the power supply lead stripped out should be prepared in advance, and
the actual supply voltage should be read through the voltmeter at the
power supply socket of the O-RU, and the actual supply current should be
read through the oscilloscope current probe. The accuracy of voltmeters
and current probes needs to be verified by a tester.

Full load power consumption test method: During the test process of each
RF performance case, the supply voltage and current of the O-RU are
recorded, and the average power consumption of each test case is
regarded as the full load power consumption. For multi-band devices, all
bands must transmit at rated power.
