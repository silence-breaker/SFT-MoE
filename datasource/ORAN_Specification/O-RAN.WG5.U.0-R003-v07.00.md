# Modal verbs terminology

In the present document \"**shall**\", \"**shall not**\",
\"**should**\", \"**should not**\", \"**may**\", \"**need not**\",
\"**will**\", \"**will not**\", \"**can**\" and \"**cannot**\" are to be
interpreted as described in clause 3.2 of the O-RAN Drafting Rules

# 1 Scope

The present document provides profiles for the EN-DC and NG-RAN related
NR U-plane procedures and functions to achieve interoperability among
different vendors. The profiles specify the expected behavior of each
node, e.g., message flow of each use case, definitions of IEs, etc.
which is not specified in 3GPP specifications. The profile specification
provided in this document does not violate 3GPP specifications. Overall
architecture in EN-DC and NG-RAN is illustrated in TS 37.340 \[1\] and
TS 38.300 \[3\], respectively. Note that the following two figures are
created by O-RAN WG5.

this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document in Release 15.

# 4 User plane function 

This section provides NR U-plane profile to achieve interoperability. In
this version of the profile, RLC-AM and RLC-UM are supported. In this
version of the profile, the following procedure is defined.

-   Flow control

## 4.1 Flow control

### 4.1.1 Elementary procedures

#### 4.1.1.1 Node behaviour of the corresponding node

-   When the corresponding node indicates Radio Link Outage over NR-U,
    the corresponding node shall not interpret the Radio Link Outage
    indication as a trigger to discard any remaining packets for RLC-AM
    and RLC-UM and shall not discard the packets unless receiving
    indication from the higher layer, e.g. RLC entity
    re-establishment/release, or buffer discard indication from the node
    hosting the NR PDCP entity.

-   Unless a situation of overload at the corresponding node is
    encountered, the corresponding node may send DDDS in the following
    cases in addition to the cases TS 38.425 \[2\] defines:

    -   Lost packet detection

    -   Radio link outage

    -   Stop scheduling for the data bearer

### 4.1.2 Elements for the NR user plane protocols

#### 4.1.2.1 General

-   For the optional fields of DDDS, if the corresponding value is not
    available yet (e.g. no valid corresponding PDCP SN to be reported as
    the corresponding node hasn\'t yet transmitted any NR PDCP PDU to
    the lower layer), the corresponding node shall not include the
    corresponding IEs (including the corresponding indication for
    presence) in the DDDS. Once the value comes to be valid or updated,
    the corresponding node shall include them at least in the next DDDS.

> NOTE: For Lost Packet Report fields, if the value is continuously
> reported in the consecutive DDDS, the node hosting the NR PDCP entity
> cannot identify whether the reported lost NR-U Sequence Number is for
> before or after the wrap around. How to prevent this is up to
> implementation.

#### 4.1.2.2 Report polling

-   The node hosting the NR PDCP entity shall use this IE to trigger the
    corresponding node to send DDDS when the Report Polling Flag set
    to 1.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The corresponding node shall send DDDS when the Report Polling Flag
    set to 1, unless a situation of overload at the corresponding node
    is encountered.

#### 4.1.2.3 Buffer discard Indication

-   The corresponding node shall support both DL Discard Blocks and DL
    Flush for the buffer discard indication.

#### 4.1.2.4 User data existence flag

-   In case of split bearer, when the corresponding node does not
    support the IE, e.g. for the corresponding node compliant with the
    former version of 3GPP specification, the node hosting the NR PDCP
    entity shall send the actual user data to notify the existence of
    user data.

#### 4.1.2.5 Assistance Information Report Polling Flag

-   The node hosting the NR PDCP entity shall use this IE to trigger the
    corresponding node sending AID whenever it needs.

> NOTE: Whether the corresponding node sends AID by itself is up to
> implementation.

#### 4.1.2.6 Radio quality assistance information

-   It is configured via M-plane which assistance information to be
    included in AID.

-   For the information configured to be reported and supported by the
    corresponding node:

    -   if corresponding value is not available yet (e.g. no valid Power
        Headroom Report to be reported as the corresponding node hasn\'t
        yet received any Power Headroom Report from the UE):

        -   the corresponding node shall not include the corresponding
            information in the reporting AID.

    -   else:

        -   the corresponding node shall include the latest value as the
            corresponding information in the consecutive AID, even when
            there is no update from the previous reported AID.

        -   when Power Headroom Report is configured to be reported and
            multiple data bearers are configured to one UE, the
            corresponding node shall include Power Headroom Report
            information in all the reporting AID.

-   For the information configured not to be reported or not supported
    by the corresponding node, the corresponding node shall not include
    the corresponding information in the AID.

#### 4.1.2.7 DL report NR PDCP PDU SN

-   The node hosting the NR PDCP entity may use this IE to trigger the
    corresponding node to send DDDS when the NR PDCP PDU with this
    sequence number has been successfully delivered.

-   The corresponding node, if supported, shall send DDDS when the NR
    PDCP PDU with the indicated DL report NR PDCP PDU SN has been
    successfully delivered, unless a situation of overload at the
    corresponding node is encountered. The DDDS sent as a response to a
    specific DL report NR PDCP PDU SN shall be sent only when all PDCP
    PDU SNs up to this DL report NR PDCP PDU have been successfully
    delivered in-sequence.
