Executive summary 
This document provides the description of the requirements and stage-2 information models to implement an Acceleration 
Abstraction Layer (AAL) for the MUMIMO Precoder/BeamFormer Calculation functionality hosted by an AAL-LPU that is 
associated with an O-RAN Network Function.   
Introduction 
This document specifies how to accelerate the functionality of an O-RAN network function where the MUMIMO 
Precoder/BeamFormer Calculation Acceleration Function (AF) is hosted on an AAL-LPU that is assigned to the AAL 
Application that is part of the O-RAN network function. This document also specifies a set of AAL Profiles and procedures for 
utilizing the AALI Common Management (AALI-C-Mgmt) and Application (AALI-C-App) interfaces to convey the 
information elements specified by the AAL Profiles.

Overview 
4.1 
Purpose  
The AAL General Aspects and Principles is described in [7] including a high-level architecture of the AAL and definition of 
the AAL profiles. This document details the AAL specification consisting of the description of the interface, information 
models, and requirements to implement an AALI for AAL_MUMIMO_PRECODER_WEIGHTS_CAL profile [7] 
 
The purpose of the AAL_MUMIMO_PRECODER_WEIGHTS_CAL profile is to support look-aside acceleration of 
beamforming (precoding) weight calculation by the Application. This profile compliments the High-PHY profiles specified in 
[8]. 
4.2 
Document Structure 
This present document is structured as follows: Chapter 4 presents the overview and main purpose of this specification. 
Chapter 5 presents the high level AALI configuration and management principles for the AAL_MU 
MIMO_PRECODER_WEIGHTS_CAL profile. Chapter 6 presents the Profile Overview for the profile, sample capabilities, 
inputs, and outputs as well as HWA parameters for the profile. 
 
5 
AAL Configuration and Management  
The AALI configuration and management APIs are the APIs that an Application (O-DU) executes to configure and manage the 
AAL-LPU(s) that have been allocated to the Application by the O-Cloud. The high-level Configuration and Management 
Principles are presented in [7].

Specification 
6.3.1 
Introduction 
The AAL_MU MIMO_PRECODER_WEIGHTS_CALC is used to support look-aside acceleration of beamforming 
(precoding) weight calculation by the Application 
6.3.2  
Profile Operation 
The Application provides HWA (aka AF in [8]) with all the information required to calculate precoding weights, as shown in 
Table 6.3.4-1. HWA computes MU-MIMO precoding weights according to an implementation-specific method, one exemplary 
method being block diagonalization. 
HWA returns to the Application a handle* (optional) to the precoding weights for the layers of the selected UEs together with 
precoding weights themselves. The precoding weights can be used by the Application to compute SINR per UE and per layer 
to assist with MCS selection.  
Application sends the precoding weights (optional) or handle (optional) to AF [8] via AAL_DOWNLINK_High-PHY Profile 
[8]. 
*Handle represents an index to “Beamforming (precoding) weights per PRG for the layers of the selected UEs” uniquely. This 
is an optional parameter. It is introduced to enable following example implementation option:  
After precoding weights calculation, HWA stores the precoding weights locally together with the associated handle. HWA 
returns to Application the handle to the precoding weights as well as the precoding weights for the layers of the selected UEs. 
This provides option to Application to send just the handle to AF [8] in AAL_DOWNLINK_High-PHY Profile [8]. In this 
case, AF can use the handle to retrieve precoding weights stored locally.  
 
NOTE: 
This is applicable only for the sencario in which same HWA is used for “high Phy function” and “precoding 
weights calculation function”.
