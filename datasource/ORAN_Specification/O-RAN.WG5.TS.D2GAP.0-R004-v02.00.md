# 4 General aspects

## 4.1 D2 interface general principles

The general principles for the specification of the D2 interface are as
follows:

-   the D2 interface is open;

-   the D2 interface supports the exchange of signalling information
    between the endpoints. In addition, the interface supports data
    transmission to the respective endpoints;

-   the D2 is a point-to-point interface between the endpoints on two
    O-DUs. A point-to-point logical interface should be feasible even in
    the absence of a physical direct connection between the two O-DUs.

-   the D2 interface supports control plane(D2-c) and user plane (D2-u)
    separation;

-   the D2 interface enables exchange of UE associated information and
    non-UE associated information;

-   the D2 interface is designed in a future proof way to fulfil new
    requirements, and services;

-   the D2 interface supports NR carrier aggregation of carriers
    configured in different O-DU nodes. The schedulers in the O-DUs
    operate independently of each other.

## 4.2 D2 interface within O-RAN architecture

O-DUs can be interconnected by the D2 interface. Figure 4.2‑1 shows the
D2 interface in the O-RAN WG1.OAD Figure 5.1-2 \[1\]. In the present
document, O-DUs interconnected by the D2 interface are connected to a
single O-CU-CP as shown in Figure 4.2‑1.

NOTE: O-DUs interconnected by the D2 interface can be connected to
different O-CU-UP. Figure 4.2‑1 shows the connection between O-DUs
connected to a single O-CU-CP.

[]{#_Ref191894751 .anchor}Figure 4.2‑1: D2 Interface for Intra CU inter
DU carrier aggregation

The D2 interface is a logical interface connecting two O-DUs for
supporting inter O-DU carrier aggregation. A pair of O-DUs can be
connected with each other by the D2 interface.

F1 (F1-c, F1-u) and E1 are logical 3GPP interfaces, whose protocols,
termination points and cardinalities are specified in 3GPP TS 38.401
\[6\]. Open FH is O-RAN defined interface as specified in O-RAN WG4.CUS
\[3\].

Using D2 interface, the O-DUs are able to exchange user data and control
information to support inter O-DU carrier aggregation. Configuration for
establishment and functioning of D2 interface (for example peer O-DU IP
address etc) is provided to O-DU by SMO over O1 interface, or by other
means such as local node configuration.

## 4.3 Functional split for PCell O-DU and SCell O-DU

The functional split in the PCell and SCell O-DU for supporting inter
O-DU DL CA is as follows:

-   The user data and control information message exchange take place at
    MAC level.

-   Single RLC per UE resides in the PCell O-DU as shown in Figure
    4.3‑1.

-   For supporting DL CA using D2 interface PUCCH allocation and
    reception of PUCCH data from UE is performed by the PCell O-DU for
    both PCell and SCells. The PCell O-DU shares the received
    information with the SCell O-DU as shown in Figure 4.3‑1

[]{#_Ref191905914 .anchor}Figure 4.3‑1:User Data exchange for inter O-DU
DL CA (PUSCH not shown)

## 4.4 D2 interface specification objectives

The D2 interface specifications facilitate the following:

-   inter connection between two O-DUs.

-   inter O-DU carrier aggregation by exchanging user and control
    information between O-DUs.

## 4.5 D2 interface capabilities

The D2 interface supports:

-   procedures to establish, maintain and release D2 connection between
    two O-DUs.

-   procedures to establish, maintain and release D2 context for storing
    the UE information across O-DUs for supporting inter O-DU CA.

-   procedures to exchange user data and control data across O-DUs to
    support the inter O-DU CA.

# 5 Functions of the D2 interface

## 5.1 General

The D2 interface provides connectivity between O-DUs to facilitate inter
O-DU carrier aggregation. Its functionality is divided into two parts:
control plane (D2-c) and user plane(D2-u). The following clauses
describe the functions supported over D2-c and D2-u.

## 5.2 D2-c function

### 5.2.1 Interface management function

The D2 setup function allows for the initial setup of a D2 connection
between two O-DUs, including exchange of the cell-level data.
Configuration of the D2 interface endpoints can be managed by the SMO to
O-DU via the O1 interface. D2 configuration can also be provided through
node specific O&M systems. The D2 setup can be initiated by any O-DU
that successfully completes the cell setup procedure. During this
process, both the originating and destined O-DUs share cell
capabilities, for example sub-carrier spacing, duplexing methods, and
TDD DL-UL configurations etc.

Once the D2 connection is established, any changes for the cells used
for inter O-DU CA, such as a cell being locked, cell unlocked,
overloaded or changes to cell configuration (including cell addition and
removal) are communicated to its peer O-DU using the D2 configuration
update function. If cell status is changed to locked or disabled,
context for all the UEs configured for inter O-DU CA in that SCell is
released.

D2 release function is used to remove the D2 connection between the two
O-DUs, so that all the related resources between the two O-DUs are
cleared.

The error indication function is used by the O-DU to indicate to the
peer O-DU that an error has occurred. For example, if parsing of D2
Configuration Update Acknowledge or D2 Setup Response fails, O-DU can
inform the peer O-DU about the failure using error indication function.

### 5.2.2 UE management function

The UE management function supports the establishment and modification
of D2 context for SCells for a UE. These functions include
establishment, modification and release of the SCells in PCell and SCell
O-DUs. The procedures include addition, deletion or modification of a
SCell for a UE in the O-DUs.

The establishment of UE addition is initiated by the PCell O-DU. It is
accepted or rejected by the SCell O-DU based on the admission control
criteria for example resource availability, loading etc. Upon reception
of successful addition response for the UE from the SCell O-DU, the
PCell O-DU sends UE Context Setup/Modification response to O-CU-CP. RRC
Reconfiguration procedure is triggered towards UE for SCell addition.
Once RRC Reconfiguration Complete is received from UE, the PCell O-DU
sends the UE Reconfiguration Completion message to the SCell O-DU.

The modification of SCell configuration for a UE is initiated by the
PCell O-DU. If an SCell for a UE is already configured in the SCell
O-DU, PCell O-DU can use modification function to add another SCell. The
modification function is also used by the PCell O-DU to update any of
the UE configuration parameters for example change of security key, UL
configuration, DRX cycle, change of measurement gap, PDU session
add/rel/mod (QoS flow add/rel, 5QI Change), DRB etc in the SCell O-DU.
If multiple SCells are configured in an SCell O-DU for a UE, this
function can also be used to release some of the SCells.

PCell O-DU uses UE release function to clear the UE context in the SCell
O-DU. This function can be used if UE is released in the PCell O-DU or
all the SCells in an SCell O-DU are deleted for a UE. Upon successful
completion, the UE information for the SCell is cleared in the SCell
O-DU.

SCell O-DU uses the modification required function to request the
release of SCell(s) for a UE. This can be triggered due to any scenario
taking place in SCell O-DU for example overloading, or cell lock or cell
down. The PCell O-DU removes the corresponding SCell reference for the
UE for which the message is received. The PCell O-DU responds back with
confirm message after successful deletion of SCells. The SCell O-DU then
clears the SCell(s) for the UE.

Figure 5.2.2‑1 captures the UE management functions.

## 5.3 D2-u function

### 5.3.1 D2-u general principles

The following principles apply to D2-u for inter O-DU DL carrier
aggregation.

-   The PCell O-DU requests the SCell O-DU to schedule new user data
    and/or retransmissions due to HARQ feedback for the UE indicating a
    range of time slots, where data can be scheduled by the SCell O-DU.
    The range is configurable.

-   Data retransmission due to HARQ feedback is executed in the same
    node where the first transmission was executed. The SCell O-DU
    stores the TB until retransmission is successful or the HARQ process
    is cleared by the PCell O-DU.

-   CSI-RS transmission for a UE that is added by D2 interface is
    triggered when an SCell is added for the UE.

### 5.3.2 Transfer of user data

Transfer of user data comprises of two functions, the data transfer
function and the UCI transfer function.

The data transfer function allows the transfer of user data between
O-DUs to support inter O-DU carrier aggregation. For DL CA, PCell O-DU
sends the user data to SCell O-DU.

The data transfer function consists of procedures that allow the
exchange of user data, scheduling related information (range of slots)
and associated control information between PCell O-DU and SCell O-DU for
supporting inter O-DU CA.

The PCell O-DU may initiate a procedure to request the SCell O-DU to
schedule a user data transmission or to schedule a HARQ retransmission
for a particular UE. With each request the PCell O-DU also indicates the
range of slots which can be used by the SCell O-DU to schedule new user
data or HARQ retransmission. The PCell O-DU may also provide the CSI
information to the SCell O-DU. The PCell O-DU may send one or more
scheduling requests.\
The SCell O-DU may reply with the scheduled user data size and/or
scheduled HARQ retransmission, as well as the air interface timing
details (i.e. slot number). The SCell O-DU may send one or more replies
to the PCell O-DU.\
Requests from the PCell O-DU and replies from the SCell O-DU are sent
asynchronously.

The PCell O-DU may send the user data matching the scheduled user data
size together with the needed PUCCH information to the SCell O-DU.

The UCI transfer function enables the PCell O-DU to share CSI reports
and/or HARQ feedback to the SCell O-DU. The PCell O-DU may also send a
TB clear-flag to indicate that no more re-transmission is needed for a
particular HARQ process. Upon reception of the TB clear-flag the SCell
O-DU may delete the TB buffer and reuse the HARQ process ID for a new
user data transmission.

Figure 5.3.2‑1 captures the flow control of user data exchange over D2
connection.

# 7 D2 application protocol structure

## 7.1 D2 control plane protocol (D2-c)

> Figure 7.1‑1 shows the protocol structure of D2-c. The application
> layer signalling protocol is referred to as D2CP

[]{#_Ref189225872 .anchor}Figure 7.1‑1: Interface Protocol structure for
D2-c

The Transport Network Layer is based on IP transport, comprising the
SCTP on top of IP. SCTP (IETF RFC 4960 \[9\] ) shall be supported as the
transport layer of D2-c control bearer (D2CP). SCTP refers to the Stream
Control Transmission Protocol developed by the Sigtran working group of
the IETF for the purpose of transporting various signalling protocols
over IP network. There shall be only one SCTP association established
between two O-DUs. No SCTP Destination Port number value was assigned by
IANA for the D2CP protocol and so networks shall rely on O-DU
configuration to select a suitable port number.

The application layer signalling protocol is referred to as D2CP (D2
Control Protocol). The Payload Protocol Identifier assigned by IANA to
be used by SCTP for the application layer protocol D2CP is 71. This
value is to be used for all deployment configurations described in the
present document. The byte order of the Payload Protocol Identifier
shall be big-endian. The O-DUs shall support a configuration with a
single SCTP association per O-DU pair.

The support of any suitable Data Link Layer protocol, e.g. PPP,
Ethernet, etc., shall not be prevented.

The O-DUs shall support IPv6 (IETF RFC 8200 \[10\]) and/or IPv4 (IETF
RFC 791 \[11\]). The IP layer of D2-c only supports point-to-point
transmission for delivering D2CP message.

Between two O-DUs connected by D2 interface:

-   A single pair of stream identifiers shall be reserved over the SCTP
    association for the sole use of D2CP elementary procedures for D2
    interface management.

-   At least one pair of stream identifiers shall be reserved for the
    sole use of D2CP elementary procedures are utilized for D2 UE
    management signalling. However, a few pairs (i.e. more than one)
    should be reserved.

-   For a single UE-associated signalling, the O-DU shall use one SCTP
    association and one SCTP stream, and the association/stream should
    not be changed during the communication of the UE-associated
    signalling.

## 7.2 D2 user plane protocol (D2-u)

Figure 7.2‑1 shows the protocol stack for D2-u.

[]{#_Toc202360151 .anchor}Figure 7.2‑1:Protocol stack for D2-u

The D2UP (D2 user plane protocol) messages are transported by UDP over
IP. Between a pair of O-DU nodes, one or more UDP ports may be used for
D2-u.

# 8 D2 interface transport requirements 

The D2 interface is specified to accommodate the latency class High75,
High100 & High200 as described in O-RAN WG9.XTRP \[2\], section 7.2. D2
interface can also function when using High500 latency but it may have
impact on performance.

# 9 D2 interface management and configuration aspects

The configuration for establishing and functioning of D2 interface is
provided by SMO via O1 interface or manualy or via node specific OAM to
O-DUs. Parameters such as IP addresses of peer O-DUs, support of CA (UL,
DL, both or None) for each cell in O-DU are needed for functioning of D2
interface.

NOTE: Detailed definition of configuration parameters will be in O1
specification.

# 10 D2 interface security requirements

Authentication and authorization of O-DUs that exchange control or data
information over D2 interface shall be supported. Existing security
algorithm for example IPSec can be used to protect the D2 interface.
User data exchanged over D2 interface is protected by PDCP (Packet Data
Convergence Protocol)\[8\].

NOTE: Security requirement for protecting the D2 interface will be
defined in security specifications.

# Annex A (informative): Deployment options

## A.1 General deployment considerations

## A.2 Deployment model A: Co-located deployments

This model considers the deployment scenarios where relevant O-RAN NFs
for carrier aggregation are co-located at a cell site. O-RAN NFs may be
supporting the same or different band/duplexing capability.

In this deployment scenario, depicted in Figure A.2‑1and Figure A.2‑2,
the MNO may deploy a new O-RU and O-DU to add a new frequency band to
the existing infrastructure. The O-DUs will be connected to the single
O-CU-CP. The O-DUs can be connected to the multiple O-CU-UPs as shown in
Figure A.2‑2. O-DUs are connected by D2 interface to support the inter
O-DU carrier aggregation.

[]{#_Ref191904447 .anchor}Figure A.2‑2:Addition of co-located O-RU and
O-DU connected with different O-CU-UPs

## A.3 Deployment model B: Non-co-located deployments

This model considers the deployment scenarios where aggregated
frequencies are served by equipment that are not co-located at a cell
site. O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP might be residing at a centralized location while
O-DUs may be located at cell site or at a centralized location.

In this deployment scenario, depicted in Figure A.3‑1 and Figure A.3‑2,
the MNO may deploy a new O-RU and O-DU to add a new frequency band, that
is not co-located with other O-RUs and O-DUs serving the same geographic
area. The O-DUs will be connected to the single O-CU-CP. The O-DUs can
be connected to the multiple O-CU-UPs as shown in Figure A.3‑2. O-DUs
are connected by D2 interface to support the inter O-DU carrier
aggregation.

and O-DU connected with different O-CU-UPs

# Annex B (informative): D2 interface Implications

## B.1 O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP

-   O-CU-CP will be able to add, delete or modify the SCells from peer
    O-DUs, connected by D2 interface and to same O-CU-CP, in UE Context
    Request/Modification procedures.

-   No impact on O-CU-UP is expected.

## B.2 Synchronization Requirements

Existing synchronization requirement specified in O-RAN WG9.XTRP \[4\]
section 6.3.3 is sufficient to meet the carrier aggregation requirement
as mentioned in 3GPP 38.133 \[7\].
