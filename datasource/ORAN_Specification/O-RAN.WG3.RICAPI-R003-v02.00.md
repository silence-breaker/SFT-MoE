# 4 General

## 4.1 Introduction

Clause 4 specifies the principles and conventions commonly applied to
Near-RT RIC API design with the Network API approach as described in
clause 7.1.2 of \[2\].

## 4.2 General Principles

For each Near-RT RIC API, the following principles should be followed:

\- A default solution that includes network protocol and message
encoding should be defined to ensure interoperability. The default
solution requires mandatory support by all Near-RT RIC platforms and
xApps. The optional protocols available for a given APIs are
discoverable by xApps.

\- The IEs in the Near-RT RIC API which refer to different
specifications shall be encoded as defined in the referred
specification.

The common data types applicable to several API categories should be
collected in clause 10.

In addition, the following design principles shall apply:

-   Parallel transactions, i.e., multiple ongoing Near-RT RIC API
    procedures of the same types related to the same xApp, and platform
    functionality are supported.

## 4.3 Version Control

An API version shall consist of at least 3 fields, following a
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern according to the Semantic Versioning
Specification \[i.1\] unless specified otherwise.

EXAMPLE: \"1.0.0\".

The basic rules as reproduced from \[i.1\] shall apply for incrementing
the versions:

\- MAJOR version is incremented if backward incompatible change is made.

\- MINOR version is incremented if functional change is made in a
backward compatible way.

\- PATCH version is incremented if correction is made in a backward
compatible way.

**Figure** **5.2.1.2‑1 : A1 Policy Setup procedure, successful
operation**

The Near-RT RIC Platform initiates the procedure by sending A1 POLICY
SETUP REQUEST message to xApp.

The A1 POLICY SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the information
required by the xApp to setup one A1 policy including *A1 Policy Type
ID* IE, *A1 Policy ID* IE, and *A1 Policy Object* IE.

Upon reception of the A1 POLICY SETUP REQUEST message, the xApp shall
transform the received A1 policy into appropriate E2 / A1-EI
operation(s) requirements, and shall trigger Near-RT RIC Platform to
accommodate E2 / A1-EI operation(s) requirements.

If Near-RT RIC Platform is able to accommodate E2 / A1-EI operation(s)
requirements, xApp replies A1 POLICY SETUP RESULT message with *A1
Policy Setup Result* IE set to *success* to Near-RT RIC Platform. And
xApp should store the received *A1 Policy Type ID* IE, *A1 Policy ID*
IE, *A1 Policy Object* IE as basic elements of A1 policy profile, and
label the status of corresponding A1 policy as "enforced".

**Figure 5.2.1.3‑1 : A1 Policy Setup procedure, unsuccessful operation**

If xApp cannot transform the received A1 policy into appropriate E2 /
A1-EI operation(s) requirements due to unsupported A1 policy type, xApp
replies A1 POLICY SETUP RESULT message with *A1 Policy Setup Result* IE
set to *failure* to Near-RT RIC Platform, possible with *Cause* IE set
to *Not supported A1 policy type.*

If xApp cannot transform the received A1 policy into appropriate E2 /
A1-EI operation(s) requirements due to violation of of the requirements
as stated in 5.2.1.2.2, 5.2.2.2.2, 5.2.3.2.2, 5.2.4.2.2, 5.2.5.2.2,
5.2.6.2.2, 5.2.7.2.2 and 5.2.8.2.2 of \[7\], xApp replies A1 POLICY
SETUP RESULT message with *A1 Policy Setup Result* IE set to *failure*
to Near-RT RIC Platform, possible with *Cause* IE set to *Not allowed
statements, restrictions and extensions.*

If Near-RT RIC Platform cannot accommodate E2 / A1-EI operation(s)
requirements, xApp replies A1 POLICY SETUP RESULT message with *A1
Policy Setup Result* IE set to *failure* to Near-RT RIC Platform,
possible with *Cause* IE set to *Near-RT RIC Platform cannot accommodate
E2 / A1-EI operations requirements.*

#### 5.2.1.4 Abnormal conditions

If A1 policy indicated by *A1 Policy Type ID* IE, *A1 Policy ID* IE
contained in A1 POLICY SETUP REQUEST message is being enforced by xApp,
xApp replies A1 POLICY SETUP RESULT message with *A1 Policy Setup
Result* IE set to *failure* to Near-RT RIC Platform, possible with
*Cause* IE set to *A1 policy already enabled at xApp.*

### 5.2.2 A1 Policy Update procedure

Upon reception of the A1 POLICY SETUP REQUEST message, the xApp shall
transform the received A1 policy into appropriate E2 / A1-EI
operation(s) requirements. If the transformed E2 / A1-EI operation(s)
requirements are the same as before, xApp replies A1 POLICY UPDATE
RESULT message with *A1 Policy Update Result* IE set to *success* to
Near-RT RIC Platform; else, xApp shall trigger Near-RT RIC Platform to
accommodate E2 / A1-EI operation(s) requirements.

If Near-RT RIC Platform to accommodate E2 / A1-EI operation(s)
requirements succeeds, xApp replies A1 POLICY UPDATE RESULT message with
*A1 Policy Update Result* IE set to *success* to Near-RT RIC Platform.
And xApp should update the stored information of *A1 Policy Object* IE
of A1 policy profile, and label the status of corresponding A1 policy as
"enforced".

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following
table. In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the
related capability is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause
values indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient
resources were available to perform the requested action.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Default protocol stack : SCTP                                                                                  Optional protocol stack : gRPC

**Figure 6.1.1-1: Protocol stacks for E2 related APIs**

The E2 related APIs may use SCTP or gRPC with Protocol Buffers \[4\] as
the application layer serialization protocol. The supported protocol by
the platform APIs is presented to the the xApps during the xApp
Discovery Procedure in clause 9.2.1.

### 6.1.2 List of E2 related APIs, procedures and messages

The E2 related API procedures introduced in clause 9.3 of \[2\] are
categorized under the E2 related APIs. These APIs include:

-   E2 Subscription API: enabling xApp to setup, modify and delete E2
    subscriptions with the Near-RT RIC platform.

-   E2 Indication API: enabling xApp to receive E2 indications
    associated with an E2 subscription.

-   E2 Control API: enabling xApp to consume E2 control service from the
    Near-RT RIC platform.

-   E2 Guidance API: enabling xApp to acquire E2 related guidance from
    the Near-RT RIC platform and mitigate potential conflicts with other
    xApps.

These APIs are summarized in Table 6.1.2-1.

**Figure 6.2.1.1.2-1: E2 Subscription procedure, successful operation**

The xApp initiates the procedure by sending an E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Request)
message to the Near-RT-RIC platform. The message contains a unique
*Procedure Transaction ID* IE assigned by the initiating xApp, the
*Global E2 Node ID* IE, the *RAN Function ID* IE, and the *E2
Subscription Details* IE including one or more requested E2 actions and
optionally the *E2 Subscription Timer* IE. The message may include the
*E2 Indication Destination* IE which specifies the xApp\'s endpoint to
receive E2 indications (see clause 6.2.2.1), and the *E2 Subscription
Delete Notification Destination* IE which specifies the xApp\'s endpoint
to receive query/notification from the Near-RT RIC platform for E2
subscription deletion (see clause 6.2.1.3/6.2.1.4).

Note: When execution order of multiple actions is not concerned, it is
recommended that an E2 Subscription procedure contains a single action,
to allow efficient reuse of E2 subscriptions.

At reception of the E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Request) message, the Near-RT-RIC
platform shall:

\- Search existing E2 subscription(s) for matched *Global E2 Node ID*
IE, *RAN Function ID* IE and matched contents in *E2 Subscription
Details* IE. If a matched E2 subscription exists, add the initiating
xApp as a new subscriber of the E2 subscription.

\- Initiate appropriate E2AP procedure(s) to establish RIC subscription
with the target E2 Node, if existing E2 subscriptions are insufficient
to fulfill the request.

The Near-RT-RIC platform may use the value in the *E2 Subscription
Timer* IE, if present, as a one-time value of the E2AP timer
T~RICEVENTcreate~ in clause 9.5 of \[3\], which is valid only for this
transaction.

If the subscription request is successfully fulfilled, the Near-RT RIC
platform shall send an E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Success) message back to the
xApp. Similar to \[3\], a successfully fulfilled request shall be sent
if the E2 event trigger and at least one requested E2 action are
admitted.

In the E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Success) message, Near-RT RIC platform shall
include the associated *Procedure Transaction ID* IE, *Global E2 Node
ID* IE, *RAN Function ID* IE and an *E2 Request ID* IE assigned by the

### 6.3.4 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax

#### 6.3.4.1 Solution 1: SCTP with Protocol Buffers

##### 6.3.4.1.1 Usage of SCTP with Protocol Buffers

This solution uses Protocol Buffers as message encoding, and SCTP as the
transport protocol.

The PDU on the SCTP connection uses the structure as defined in clause
10.1.8 where its API Payload IE serves as a container for individual API
messages in clause 6.3.4.1.2 which can be E2SubscriptionApiPayload or
E2IndicationApiPayload or E2ControlApiPayload.

Table 6.3.4.1.1-1 lists the E2 related APIs abstract syntax included in
this document.

# 7 SDL API

## 7.1 Overview

### 7.1.1 Protocol Stack

In this version of specification, the default and optional protocol
stacks for the SDL APIs are shown on Figure 7.1.1-1.

Note: The security protocols are specified in \[6\].

**Figure 7.1.1-1: Protocol stack for SDL APIs**

The SDL APIs may use the SCTP or gRPC with Protocol Buffers \[4\] as the
application layer serialization protocol. The supported protocol by the
platform API is presented to the xApps during the xApp Discovery
Procedure in clause 9.2.1.

### 7.1.2 List of SDL APIs, procedures and messages

The SDL API procedures introduced in clause 9.5 of \[2\] are categorized
under the SDL APIs. These APIs include:

-   SDL Information API: enabling subscription and retrieval of
    > information by xApps.

-   xApp Data Sharing API: enabling xApp to share specific data with
    > Near-RT RIC platform and/or other data consumer xApps.

These APIs are summarized in Table 7.1.2-1.

### 7.3.4 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax

7.3.4.1 Solution 1: SCTP with Protocol Buffers

7.3.4.1.1 Usage of SCTP with Protocol Buffers

This solution uses Protocol Buffers as message encoding, and SCTP as the
transport protocol.

The PDU on the SCTP connection uses the structure as defined in clause
10.1.8 where its API Payload IE serves as a container for individual API
messages in clause 7.3.4.1.2 which can be SdlInformationApiPayload or
XappDataSharingApiPayload.

Table 7.3.4.1.1-1 lists the SDL APIs abstract syntax included in this
document.

**Figure 8.2.1.2-1: xApp Registration procedure, successful operation**

The xApp initiates the procedure by sending an xApp Registration
(Request) message to the Near-RT-RIC platform. The message contains a
unique *Procedure Transaction ID* IE assigned by the initiating xApp,
the optional *xApp Description* IE*,* and the *Required APIs and Data
Types* IE that specifies the APIs and data types needed for normal
operation of the xApp.

At reception of the xApp Registration (Request) message, the Near-RT-RIC
platform shall:

\- Check xApp's compatibility with the Near-RT RIC platform, using
information in the *Required APIs and Data Types* IE.

\- Assign an xApp ID and create the profile for the xApp.

If the registration request is successfully fulfilled, the Near-RT RIC
platform shall send an xApp Registration (Success) message back to the
xApp.

In the xApp Registration (Success) message, the Near-RT RIC platform
shall include the associated *Procedure Transaction ID* IE and the *xApp
ID* IE.

## 10.1 Information element definitions

### 10.1.1 PTI

The Procedure Transaction Identity (PTI) IE allows identifing a
procedure among all ongoing parallel procedures of the same type
initiated by the same RICAPI peer. The PTI value is assigned to the
initiating message by the procedure initiator, and subsequent messages
shall include the same PTI value as in the initiating message, if any.
PTI is released when the procedure is completed.
