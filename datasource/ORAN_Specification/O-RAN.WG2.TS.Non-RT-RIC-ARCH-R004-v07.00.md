# 4 Overview

## 4.1 Non-RT RIC in O-RAN overall architecture

Non-Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Non-RT RIC) is the
functionality internal to the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO)
framework in O-RAN overall architecture, as shown in O-RAN OAD\[2\].

-   Non-RT RIC represents a subset of functionality of the SMO
    framework.

-   Non-RT RIC supports intelligent RAN operation and optimization.

-   Non-RT RIC logically terminates the A1 interface, and it provides
    policy-based guidance and enrichment information to the Near-RT
    RICs. AI/ML model management on the A1 interface is not specified in
    the present document.

-   Non-RT RIC can access other SMO framework functionalities, for
    example influencing what is carried across the O1, open fronthaul
    M-plane and O2 interface.

# 6 Non-RT RIC Architecture

## 6.1 General

Non-RT RIC is comprised of:

-   Non-RT RIC Framework -- Functionality internal to the SMO Framework
    that:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Logically terminates the A1 interface to the Near-RT RIC.

-   Exposes set of R1 services to Non-RT RIC Applications (rApps).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Non-RT RIC Applications (rApps) -- Applications that leverage the
    functionalities available in the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework to provide
    value added services related to RAN operation and optimization. The
    scope of rApps includes, but is not limited to, RAN configuration
    management, data analytics, producing training services, generating
    A1 policies, and providing enrichment information.

The following figure depicts the reference architecture of the Non-RT
RIC as part of the SMO framework.

Figure 6.1-1: Non-RT RIC reference architecture

There are three categories of logical functions in Non-RT RIC framework
and SMO framework:

-   Functions anchored inside the Non-RT RIC framework, which are
    indicated in solid blue box in figure 6.1-1.

-   Functions anchored outside the Non-RT RIC framework, which are
    indicated in solid orange box in figure 6.1-1.

-   Non-anchored functions, which are indicated in dashed line box in
    figure 6.1-1.

The categories are defined in clause 3.1. The definitions make no
assumption on the mandatory or optional qualifier of the functions being
anchored or non-anchored.

The decomposition of logical functions is not mandatory, and it is up to
vendor's implementation.

NOTE 1: There might be other SMO framework functions or other Non-RT RIC
framework functions which may provide additional services exposed via
the R1 interface or provide EI for A1 enrichment information services.
These are not specified in the present document.

NOTE 2: Other SMO framework functions may be defined by other O-RAN WGs
and the potential impacts on Non-RT RIC architecture are not specified
in the present document.

NOTE 3: Whether the A1-related functions are anchored functions or not
is not specified in the present document.

NOTE 4: Among other functionalities, the Other SMO framework functions
also realize OAM functionality related to RAN-specific network slicing.

Service management and exposure functions enable (not limited to):
service registration, service discovery, service notification,
authorization, authentication, communication support, and optional
bootstrap.

The rApp management functions enable the management of rApps within the
context of the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework. Such functions enable (not
limited to) the configuration of rApps, providing access to fault and
performance related information from rApps, and facilitation of rApp
logging functionality. Through the use of R1, rApp management functions
can provide access to these functionalities in a consistent manner to
all rApps. Such consistency is particularly valuable as rApps can be
provided independently by different rApp vendors.

The implementation-specific interfaces, which are indicated by the
dashed line in figure 6.1-1, allow the logical functions in SMO/Non-RT
RIC framework to communicate with each other by means outside the scope
of the present document.

## 6.2 R1 interface

The R1 interface is a service-based interface via which the R1 services
can be consumed and produced.

The R1 services are a collection of services produced and consumed by
logical functions in the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework or by rApps.

The invoker of an R1 service is referred to as R1 Service Consumer and
the provider of an R1 service is referred to as R1 Service Producer. R1
Service Consumers can be rApps and/or SMO/Non-RT RIC framework
functions. Further, R1 Service Producers can be rApps and/or SMO/Non-RT
RIC framework functions.

The R1 termination enables the R1 Service Producers and R1 Service
Consumers to exchange messages via the R1 interface.

An rApp as well as a SMO/Non-RT RIC framework function can produce zero
or more R1 Services, likewise an rApp as well as a SMO/Non-RT RIC
framework function can consume zero or more R1 Services.

The R1 termination enables the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework and the rApps to
exchange messages via the R1 interface, assuming that the R1 service
APIs and the rApps are registered with the R1 service management and
exposure functions.

The communication support provided by the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework
allows R1 Service Producers and R1 Service Consumers to exchange
messages related to the R1 services. Different deployment options are
possible, such as:

-   Plain connectivity that enables the point-to-point exchange of
    service-related messages between R1 Service Producers and R1 Service
    Consumers e.g. over HTTP.

-   Service meshes that enable the combination of discovery of R1
    service API endpoints with the routing of service-related messages
    between R1 Service Consumers and R1 Service Producers.

-   Message buses that enable R1 Service Producers to send
    service-related messages to zero or more R1 Service Consumers
    simultaneously.

-   API gateways that enable routing of service-related messages between
    R1 Service Consumers and R1 Service Producers and that may enforce
    authorization policies.

# 7 R1 Service Definitions

## 7.1 General description

A service is a set of capabilities related to each other, offered by a
Service Producer to Service Consumer(s) for consumption. The
capabilities within a service typically have a common purpose and can be
inter-dependent. In order to improve re-usability, the mutual coupling
across any two services is usually avoided or minimized. Services are
produced by Service Producers and consumed by Service Consumers through
service endpoints (typically APIs). The interoperability of Service
Producers and Service Consumers is ensured by support of the related
service endpoints, but it does not depend on the decomposition of
logical functions. Being a Service Producer and/or a Service Consumer is
a role of an rApp or of a logical function in the SMO or the Non-RT RIC
framework (see clause 6).

The set of R1 services which can be accessed via the R1 interface
includes (but is not limited to):

-   Service management and exposure services, which include service
    registration and service discovery services, authentication
    services, authorization services and communication support services.
    The service management and exposure services support extensibility
    of the set of R1 services.

-   Data management and exposure services, which deliver data created or
    collected by Data Producers to Data Consumers according to their
    needs.

-   A1-related services, which provide access to functionality related
    to A1.

-   AI/ML workflow services, which provide access to AI and ML workflow.

-   RAN OAM-related services, which provide access to RAN OAM
    functionality related to the O1 and open fronthaul M-plane
    interfaces, and to the OAM functionality related to RAN-specific
    network slicing in the SMO framework.

-   O2-related services, which provide access to functionality related
    to O2.

-   rApp management services, which provide functionality for managing
    rApps.

-   TE&IV-related services, which provide access to topology and
    inventory data.

NOTE: A part of the services listed above may be used on other
O-RAN-defined interfaces as well.

## 7.2 Service management and exposure services

The following service management and exposure services are defined:

-   Bootstrap service (optional): It enables an rApp to discover the
    endpoints of the service management and exposure service.

-   Registration of services: It allows to register services which
    includes storing and maintaining profile about each service. It
    further allows to deregister services and delete the service
    profile.

-   Discovery of services: It supports service discovery for a Service
    Consumer to find services based on its selection criteria if it is
    provided. Further, based on the subscription, it notifies its
    Service Consumers about the newly registered/updated/deregistered
    services.

-   Authentication: It allows the authentication of a Service Producer
    and/or a Service Consumer.

-   Authorisation: It supports to grant Service Consumers access to
    registered R1 services and to allow Service Producers to produce R1
    services.

-   Communication support (optional): It supports interaction of R1
    Service Consumers and Producers with each other.

NOTE: Communication support is not specified in the present document.

## 7.3 Data management and exposure services

The following data management and exposure services are defined:

-   Data registration service: Data registration allows Data Producers
    to communicate information about the DME types that they are able to
    produce. Data Producers need to be authorized to register DME types.

-   Data discovery service: Data discovery allows Data Consumers to
    discover available DME types in the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework. Data
    Consumers need to be authorized to discover DME types.

-   Data subscription service: Using the subscribe data procedure, it
    allows Data Consumers to consume data continuously from the
    SMO/Non-RT RIC framework and it further allows the SMO/Non-RT RIC
    framework to collect data continuously from Data Producers.

-   Data request service: Using the request data procedure, it allows
    Data Consumers to consume data once from the SMO/Non-RT RIC
    framework and it further allows the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework to
    collect data once from Data Producers.

-   Data delivery services: These allow to deliver data for consumption
    from the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework to Data Consumers. They further
    allow to deliver data for collection from Data Producers to the
    SMO/Non-RT RIC framework.

-   Data offer service: It allows a Data Producer to trigger the
    collection of a data instance by the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework from
    this Data Producer.

-   Data processing services (optional): These allow Service Consumers
    to access data processing in the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework.

NOTE: Data processing services are not specified in the present
document.

Data Producers (e.g., rApps) communicate information about the DME types
that they produce in data registration. Data Producers can communicate
constraints related to the authorization of the Data Consumers to
discover registered DME types and access produced data. Data Producers
communicate information about how the data are collected by the
SMO/Non-RT RIC framework (e.g., collection periodicity, event-trigger
conditions, push or pull, etc.).

Data Consumers (e.g., rApps) communicate information about the DME types
that they want to discover. Data Consumers subscribe/request data from
the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework for consumption with specific DME type,
periodicity, and delivery (or reporting) method, scope, etc. The
delivery (or reporting) method contains information about how the
subscribed/requested data are delivered from the SMO/Non-RT RIC
framework (e.g., delivery periodicity, event-trigger conditions, push or
pull, etc.).

A Data Producer that intends to trigger the collection of a data
instance that it produces defines a data offer by providing to the
SMO/Non-RT RIC framework information about the data instance it intends
to produce. The information about the data offer includes the properties
of the data instance and the supported delivery services. The collection
of the data instance starts when the data offer creation has been
confirmed by the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework.

SMO/Non-RT RIC framework collects data produced by Data Producers.
SMO/Non-RT RIC framework delivers data to Data Consumers for
consumption. SMO/Non-RT RIC framework stores collected data. If the
collection of the data was triggered by a data subscription or data
request, data storage is optional. SMO/Non-RT RIC framework can
optionally process collected and/or stored data (e.g., quantization,
normalization, labelling, correlation, etc.).

    existing policy types are removed, etc.).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Creating, updating, querying, and deleting A1 policies.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   rApp creates A1 policies in the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework. SMO/Non-RT

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   rApp subscribes/unsubscribes notifications for the creation,
    modification, and deletion of A1 policies created by other rApps.
    SMO/Non-RT RIC framework notifies rApp of the subscribed events
    (e.g., a new A1 policy is created, an A1 policy is updated, an A1
    policy is removed, etc.), if the rApp is authorized by the
    SMO/Non-RT RIC framework to receive notifications related to A1
    policies created by other rApps.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Subscription request can be based on a given scope to which A1
    policies are applied (e.g., a UE, a group of UEs, a slice, a QoS
    flow, a cell, a Near-RT RIC, a policy type, etc.).

    rApp.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   rApp subscribes/unsubscribes notifications for changes in
    enforcement status of A1 policies. SMO/Non-RT RIC framework notifies
    rApp of the subscribed events. If the subscription request applies
    to the A1 policies created by other rApps, rApp needs authorization
    from the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework to receive notifications for
    enforcement status changes of A1 policies created by other rApps.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Subscription request can be based on a given scope to which A1
    policies are applied (e.g., a UE, a group of UEs, a slice, a QoS
    flow, a cell, a Near-RT RIC, a policy type, etc.).

## 8.2 Service management and exposure functions 

### 8.2.1 Service registration and discovery functions

The service registration and discovery functions are logical functions
that produce the service registration, service deregistration, service
discovery, service notification, communication support services and
optional bootstrap services specified in clause 7.2.

Examples of Service Producers include: service management and exposure
services producer, A1-related services producer, etc. Examples of
Service Consumers are rApps. It is noted that rApps can also be Service
Producers and logical functions can also be Service Consumers.

A Service Producer or an entity acting on its behalf can send a service
registration request to the service registration and discovery functions
to register services. A Service Consumer can either send a service
discovery request to the service registration and discovery functions to
discover the services and the endpoints on which they can be consumed,
or it can send a service request directly if it receives a service
notification with the related information on the service and on the
endpoints on which it can be consumed.

### 8.2.2 Authentication and authorisation functions

The authentication and authorisation functions are logical functions
that produce the authentication and authorisation services specified in
clause 7.2.

## 8.3 Data management and exposure functions

The data management and exposure functions are logical functions that
produce the data registration and discovery service, the data request
and subscription service, the data offer service and optional data
processing services specified in clause 7.3. They further initiate data
collection by consuming the data request and subscription service.
Additionally, they produce and consume the data delivery services in
order to obtain collected data from Data Producers and to allow Data
Consumers to obtain data from the data management and exposure functions
for consumption.

The data management and exposure functions track DME types that are
registered. They match data discovery requests against such DME types.
If the DME type is registered, the data management and exposure
functions identify a valid Data Producer, which can be a previously
registered Data Producer rApp or other Data Producers in the SMO/Non-RT
RIC framework (e.g., RAN OAM-related functions). The data management and
exposure functions optionally provide data processing functionality on
collected data (e.g., quantization, normalization, correlation,
labelling, etc.).

When Data Consumers use the subscribe data procedure to initiate
continuous data consumption, the data management and exposure functions
check the availability of the subscribed data after receiving a data
subscription request from a Data Consumer. If the subscribed data are
already being collected, the data management and exposure functions
deliver the data to the Data Consumer when they become available. If the
data are not already being collected and a valid Data Producer is
identified, the data management and exposure functions initiate data
collection to obtain data from the identified Data Producer. When the
collected data become available, the data management and exposure
functions deliver the data to the Data Consumer.

When Data Consumers use the request data procedure to initiate one-time
data consumption, the data management and exposure functions check the
availability of the required data after receiving a one-time data
request from a Data Consumer. If the requested data are available, the
data management and exposure functions deliver the data to the Data
Consumer. If the data are not available and a valid Data Producer is
identified, the data management and exposure functions initiate data
collection to obtain data from the identified Data Producer. When the
collected data become available, the data management and exposure
functions deliver the data to the Data Consumer.

When a Data Producer uses the create data offer procedure to trigger
data collection, the data management and exposure functions set up an
endpoint for receiving data availability notifications or push data
messages (depending on the delivery method chosen) and confirm the
creation of the data offer to the Data Producer. Data collection starts
once the data offer creation is confirmed and proceeds until the data
offer is terminated by the Data Producer or by the data management and
exposure functions. The data management and exposure functions store the
collected data for later consumption.

The use of a data repository for storing data during data collection is
optional if data collection was triggered by a data request or data
subscription from a Data Consumer. It is required if data collection was
triggered by a data offer from a Data Producer. Data can be optionally
pre-processed before being stored and can be optionally post-processed
after being read.

NOTE: Instead of storing data in a data repository, data management and
exposure functions can broker data from Data Producers to Data
Consumers.

## 9.2 Void

# 10 Procedures

## 10.1 Data management and exposure procedures

### 10.1.0 Overview

This clause demonstrates example procedures related to data management
and exposure (DME) services produced and consumed by SMO/Non-RT RIC
framework. A Data Consumer rApp requests/subscribes data from SMO/Non-RT
RIC framework, and the requested/subscribed data are collected from
another Data Producer rApp or other O-RAN entities.

NOTE: It is not required to use the same type of DME services procedure
in data consumption and data collection.

Data consumption denotes the procedures of Data Consumer rApp
requesting/subscribing data from SMO/Non-RT RIC framework. Data
collection denotes the procedures of SMO/Non-RT RIC framework
requesting/subscribing data from Data Producer rApps or other O-RAN
entities.

### 10.1.1 Subscribe data procedures in data consumption and collection 

Figure 10.1.1-1 illustrates an example workflow of using DME services to
subscribe data and deliver data over the R1 interface. In this example,
it is assumed that

-   Two Data Consumer rApps subscribe the same data instance (i.e., same
    DME type and scope) from the DME functions.

-   The requested data are produced by a Data Producer rApp.

-   The DME functions subscribe data instance from the Data Producer
    rApp.

-   Data are delivered using pull or push data delivery or by point to
    multipoint streaming data delivery. In case of pull delivery, the
    pull delivery details can be contained in subscribe data response or
    data availability notification. The Data Consumer makes a pull
    request based on the received pull delivery details. In case of
    point to multipoint streaming data delivery, DME functions inform
    the Data Consumer which data stream endpoint to consume the
    subscribed data from.

When the first Data Consumer rApp initiates the Subscribe data procedure
to obtain data, the DME functions first identify the Data Producer for
the requested data instance. In this example, one Data Producer rApp
which is already registered as being capable of producing the subscribed
data are identified as the Data Producer. The DME functions figure out
there is no data subscription for the requested data instance yet, and
the DME functions subscribe data from Data Producer rApp. In case of
pull delivery, the Data Producer rApp notifies the data availability to
the DME functions and provides pull data details in the notification.
The DME functions then pull data from the Data Producer rApp. In case of
push delivery, the Data Producer rApp pushes the data to the DME
functions. The DME functions may optionally process the data or store
the data in the data repository for future usage. In case of pull
delivery, the DME functions further notify the data availability to the
first Data Consumer rApp. The rApp then pulls the data from the DME
functions. In case of push delivery, the DME functions push the data to
the Data Consumer rApp. In case of point to multipoint streaming data
delivery, the DME functions configures the data stream endpoint unless
it is already configured. The Data Producer rApp writes the data to the
stream endpoint and Data Consumer rApp reads the data from the stream
endpoint.

When the second Data Consumer rApp sends a data subscription request to
the DME functions, the DME functions find out that the data subscription
for the requested data instance is already established. Therefore, the
DME functions do not set up additional data subscription with the Data
Producer rApp. Once new data are available, the following steps are
executed: In case of pull delivery, the Data Producer notifies the data
availability to the DME functions, and these pull the data from the Data
Producer. In case of push delivery, the Data Producer pushes the data to
the DME functions. The DME functions may optionally process the data and
store the data in the data repository for future usage. In case of pull
delivery, the DME functions further notify the data availability to both
Data Consumer rApps which then pull the data from the DME functions. In
case of push delivery, the DME functions push the data to both Data
Consumer rApps. In case of point to multipoint streaming data delivery,
the DME functions inform the second Data Consumer rApp which data stream
endpoint to use. The Data Producer rApp writes the data to the data
stream endpoint and the Data Consumer rApp reads the data from the data
stream endpoint.

The DME functions can use different procedures to deliver data to Data
Consumer rApps even if both Data Consumer rApps subscribe the same data
instance. For example, the DME functions can notify data availability to
the one Data Consumer rApp allowing the rApp to pull data, meanwhile the
DME functions push data to another Data Consumer or both the Data
Consumer rApps read the data from the data stream endpoint provided by
the DME functions.

NOTE 1: Push content can be (1) notifications that carry a data payload
or (2) streams of data.

NOTE 2: Notifications, pull data delivery, and push data delivery may
require the set-up of a dedicated communication channel that allows the
content to be pulled/pushed. Such dedicated communication channels may
map to, e.g., Kafka topic, WebSocket connection, gRPC connection, etc.
Alternatively, individual HTTP requests may be used as push messages.

Figure 10.1.1-1: Example workflow using subscribe data and notify data
availability procedures

Figure 10.1.1-2 illustrates an example workflow of using unsubscribe
data procedures to terminate data subscription in data consumption data
and data collection. In the example, it is assumed that the two Data
Consumer rApps in the figure are the only two Data Consumers which have
subscribed the data instance produced by the Data Producer rApp.

When the second Data Consumer rApp initiates the unsubscribe data
procedure, the DME functions find out that the produced data are also
subscribed by the first Data Consumer rApp. Therefore, the DME functions
can\'t unsubscribe from the Data Producer rApp.

When the first Data Consumer rApp initiates the unsubscribe data
procedure, the DME functions figure out that the data subscription is no
longer needed. Hence, in this example, the DME functions identify the
Data Producer rApp and send an unsubscription request to cancel the data
subscription. In case of point to multipoint streaming data delivery,
the Data Producer rApp stops producing the data to the data stream
endpoint.

NOTE 3: The DME functions are not required to unsubscribe data from Data
Producers even if there are no Data Consumers requesting or subscribing
these data. The DME functions may collect data from Data Producers for
its own purposes.

### 10.1.2 Request data procedure in data consumption and data collection

Figure 10.1.2-1 illustrates an example workflow of using DME services to
request and deliver data over the R1 interface. In this example, it is
assumed that

-   Two Data Consumer rApps request the same data instance (i.e., same
    DME type and scope) using request data procedure.

-   The requested data are produced by a Data Producer rApp.

-   The DME functions request data from the Data Producer rApp using
    request data procedure.

-   Data are delivered using pull delivery. The pull delivery details
    are contained in the request data response. The Data Consumer makes
    a pull request based on the received pull delivery details.

-   The pull delivery details provide Data Consumer information of how
    to formulate a pull data request for the delivery of requested data
    (e.g., a URI from which to fetch the data).

When the first Data Consumer rApp initiates the request data procedure
to obtain data, the DME functions first check whether the requested data
are available in the data repository. In this example, it figures out
that data are not available. Then the DME functions identify the Data
Producer rApp as the Data Producer, e.g., based on DME type registration
records. The DME functions send data request to the Data Producer rApp,
and the data are delivered from the Data Producer rApp using pull
delivery. The DME functions then send data request response to the first
Data Consumer rApp carrying pull delivery details. The first Data
Consumer rApp pulls data from the DME functions. The DME functions may
optionally process data and store the data in the data repository for
future usage.

When the second Data Consumer rApp sends data request to the DME
functions, the DME functions notice that the requested data are already
available in the data repository. Then the DME functions retrieve
requested data from data repository and responds the second Data
Consumer rApp with pull delivery details. The data are pulled by the
second Data Consumer rApp.

### 10.1.3 O1 related data collection procedures based on data subscription

Figure 10.1.3-1 illustrates an example workflow of how DME functions in
the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework collect O1-related data based on the data
subscription from a Data Consumer rApp.

In this example, when the Data Consumer rApp initiates the subscribe
data procedure to obtain O1 related data, the DME functions acknowledge
the data subscription, and check whether subscribed data are being
collected already or not. If the subscribed data are not being
collected, the DME functions initiates data collection procedure to
collect from nodes terminating the O1 interface via the RAN OAM-related
functions. The related procedures have been specified in O-RAN OAM Arch
\[8\], clause 4.2.2 "O-RAN Measurement Data Collection Use Case". When
the DME functions receive the collected data from the RAN OAM-related
functions, they notify the Data Consumer rApp, and the subscribed data
are delivered using pull or push data services.

NOTE: Data delivery procedures are defined in O-RAN R1GAP \[9\], clause
5.2.6.

### 10.1.4 O2 related data collection procedures based on data subscription

Figure 10.1.4-1 illustrates an example workflow of how DME functions in
the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework collect O2 related data based on the data
subscription from a Data Consumer rApp.

In this example, when the Data Consumer rApp initiates the subscribe
data procedure to obtain O2 related data, the DME functions acknowledge
the data subscription, and check whether subscribed data are being
collected already or not. If the subscribed data are not being
collected, the DME functions initiate Data collection procedure to
collect from DMS via the O2 related functions. This procedure has been
specified in O-RAN OAM Arch \[8\], clause 4.2.2 "O-RAN Measurement Data
Collection Use Case". When the DME functions receive the collected data
from the O2 related functions, it notifies the Data Consumer rApp, and
the subscribed data are delivered using pull or push data services.

### 10.1.5 Data offer procedures 

Figure 10.1.5-1 illustrates an example workflow of using the DME
services by a Data Producer to trigger the DME functions to collect a
data instance produced by that Data Producer and to store it for later
consumption.

The Data Producer rApp first needs to register a DME type for the data
instance it intends to produce. The rApp then initiates the create data
offer procedure to trigger the collection of a data instance of that DME
type which it intends to produce. The parameters of the data instance
and the supported delivery services are indicated in the request. After
receiving the request, the DME functions first check whether the Data
Producer has registered the DME type for which it intends to produce an
instance. Upon success, the DME functions set up an endpoint for the
reception of data availability notifications or push data messages,
depending on the delivery service chosen, and communicate this
information to the Data Producer. Data collection can start immediately
after the data offer creation has been acknowledged by the DME
functions.

When data are available, the Data Producer sends a data availability
notification to the DME functions and these pull the data, or the Data
Producer pushes the data to the DME functions. Then, the DME functions
store these data for subsequent consumption.

When the Data Producer intends to stop data production, it terminates
the data offer by using the terminate data offer procedure. Data
collection ends upon successful execution of that procedure. When the
data management and exposure functions intend to stop receiving produced
data, they send a data offer termination notification to the Data
Producer. Subsequently, possibly after a delay to allow the Data
Producer to react to the notification, the data management and exposure
functions stop data collection and terminate the data offer. Upon
receiving this notification, the Data Producer stops data production.

## 10.2 A1-related procedures

### 10.2.1 EI results collection from rApps

Figure 10.2.1-1 illustrates an example workflow of collecting data from
rApps (over the R1 interface) that is delivered as EI job results to the
Near-RT RICs (over the A1 interface). EI job results refer to the data
being transferred from the Non-RT RIC to the Near-RT RICs, while EI
source data refers to the data produced by the rApp that acts as the
source for the data provided as EI job results. Correspondingly, EI type
refers to the data type that is made available to the Near-RT RICs while
the corresponding DME type registered by the rApp is referred to as EI
source DME type. Moreover, EI job refers to a request for EI by the
Near-RT RIC while EI source data subscription refers to the
corresponding subscription to the rApp that acts the source for the
data.

NOTE 1: EI source data type refers to any DME type that is registered
with the DME functions and the corresponding data are used as the source
of EI job results.

The rApp which generates the enrichment information first registers the
EI source DME type in the DME functions. After successful DME type
registration, the rApp registers the EI type for which it can produce
enrichment information to the A1 enrichment information functions. In
the registration request, the rApp should include the EI source DME type
registered in the DME functions. The EI type is to be exposed via the A1
interface to the Near-RT RIC. The EI source DME type allows the A1
enrichment information functions to subscribe EI source data from DME
functions.

The A1 enrichment information functions query DME functions about the EI
source DME type. If the query is successful, the EI type registered by
the rApp is made available over the A1 interface. The Near-RT RIC
queries available EI type identifiers in the Non-RT RIC. The Near-RT RIC
queries EI type and creates an EI job via the A1 interface. After
receiving the EI job creation request from the Near-RT RIC, the A1
enrichment information functions subscribe EI source data from DME
functions. The DME functions further subscribe EI source data from the
rApp over the R1 interface.

Each time new EI source data are available, the rApp delivers EI source
data to the DME functions using pull or push delivery. The DME functions
deliver EI source data to the A1 enrichment information functions. The
A1 enrichment formation functions establish the connection with Near-RT
RIC and push the EI job results via the A1 interface.

NOTE 2: SMO/Non-RT RIC framework internal interactions are not
specified.

NOTE 3: As an alternative to using the data subscription procedure, the
data request procedure can be used to collect EI source data from the
rApp.

### 10.2.2 rApp creating a policy with a Near-RT RIC identifier

Figure 10.2.2-1 illustrates an example workflow of rApp creating a
policy over the R1 interface with a Near-RT RIC identifier, and the
Non-RT RIC creates the corresponding A1 policy at a Near-RT RIC over the
A1 interface. In this example, it is assumed that the rApp obtained the
Near-RT RIC identifier by consuming other R1 services.

The rApp sends create policy request to the A1 policy functions in the
SMO/Non-RT RIC framework, providing the policy object and a Near-RT RIC
identifier. The A1 policy functions validate the creation request, e.g.,
whether the identified Near-RT RIC is operating, whether the rApp is
authorized to create an A1 policy in the identified Near-RT RIC, whether
the policy object provided in request is valid against the policy type
schema, etc.

If the validation fails, then A1 policy functions send the failure
indication in the create policy response to rApp. Otherwise, the A1
policy functions generate an identifier for the policy and send a create
A1 policy request to the target Near-RT RIC, including the policy
identifier and the A1 policy object.

If the Near-RT RIC indicates a successful creation in the create A1
policy response, the create policy response to the rApp over R1 carries
the successful indication and the policy identifier. The rApp assumes
that the policy is now enforced in the target Near-RT RIC. If the policy
creation in A1 fails, then the Near-RT RIC sends proper error codes in
the create A1 policy response. The A1 policy functions forward the
failure indication to the rApp.

### 10.3.1 Alarm query procedure

Figure 10.3.1-1 illustrates an example workflow of querying alarm
information. Alarm information from the nodes terminating the O1
interface is typically received by the SMO via O1. It is consolidated by
the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework and can be queried by rApps via the R1
interface. Alternatively the rApps identify the cells and its associated
NF instances as specified in TE&IV-UCR \[15\] clause 4.2 , and use it as
an filter criteria to query the alarm information.

NOTE: M-Plane alarms and slice alarms are not specified in the present

### 10.3.2 Change alarm acknowledgement state procedure

Figure 10.3.2-1 illustrates an example workflow of changing the
acknowledgement state of an alarm. Alarm information from the nodes
terminating the O1 interface is typically received by the SMO via O1. It
is consolidated by the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework. The rApps can change
the acknowledgement state of the alarms that are known by the SMO/Non-RT
RIC framework. Alarm acknowledgment state information is usually managed
by the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework and is only passed to the radio nodes /
Near-RT RIC if alarm acknowledgement / unacknowledgement is supported by
these entities.

NOTE: M-Plane alarms and slice alarms are not specified in the present
document.

### 10.3.3 Read configuration data procedure

Figure 10.3.3-1 and figure 10.3.3-2 illustrate an example workflow of
reading the current CM configurations of the network elements. CM
configuration data from the RAN nodes terminating the O1 interface is
typically received by the SMO via O1. It is cached and continuously
synchronized by the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework (see figure 10.3.3-1) and
can be retrieved by rApps via the R1 interface (see figure 10.3.3-2).
The read configuration data request initiated by rApps may contain
requests for reading configuration data for multiple RAN nodes in order
to save bandwidth on the R1 interface.

NOTE: Read configuration data procedure is defined in O-RAN R1GAP \[9\],
clause 5.4.5.

Figure 10.3.3-2: Example workflow for read configuration data procedure

The RAN OAM-related functions may maintain a local data store
(implementation specific) caching part or all of the CM configurations
of the RAN nodes for fast retrieval of configuration data from rApps and
minimizing the signalling overhead on the O1 interface. In this example,
as illustrated in figure 10.3.3-1, the RAN OAM-related functions
synchronize the configuration data in its local data store with the RAN
nodes continuously based on read MOI attributes procedures or
notifications of MOI attribute changes over the O1 interface or internal
knowledge of the attribute changes made by the rApps and framework
functions within the SMO which is implementation specific. When the rApp
initiates the read configuration data procedure, as illustrated in
figure 10.3.3-2, the RAN OAM-related functions optionally check if the
requested configuration data has been collected already and is up to
date. The requested configuration data by the rApp might not be always
cached in the local data store. If the requested data has not being
collected, the RAN OAM-related functions initiate read MOI attributes
procedures to collect the latest configuration data from the RAN nodes
via the O1 interface as specified in O-RAN O1 interface \[11\], clause
6.1.5.3. Finally, a read configuration data response with the latest
configuration data is sent to rApp by the RAN OAM-related functions.

### 10.3.4 Write configuration changes procedure

Figure 10.3.4-1 illustrates an example workflow of writing the CM
configuration changes to the network elements. CM configurations in the
RAN nodes terminating the O1 interface are typically managed by the SMO
via O1. Configuration information is consolidated by the SMO/Non-RT RIC
framework and can be modified by rApps via the R1 interface. The write
configuration changes request initiated by rApps may contain bundled
write requests for multiple RAN nodes in order to save bandwidth on the
R1 interface.

Figure 10.3.4-1: Example workflow for write configuration changes
procedure

The write configuration changes request is handled in asynchronous
approach. When the rApp initiates the write configuration changes
procedure, the RAN OAM-related functions authenticate the request with
SME, validate the request, store the request as job and acknowledge the
request by sending write configuration changes response indicating that
the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing job has
not been completed. An assigned requested identifying the created
processing job is included in the response. The actual processing job
for the write configuration changes request which includes e.g.,
conflict detection, conflict mitigation and writing the configuration
changes to each RAN node as requested via the O1 interface, happens
asynchronously. If the rApp has subscribed for the notification of the
write configuration changes job status, the RAN OAM-related functions
send a notification to the rApp once the write configuration changes job
is complete, indicating the completion of the job and providing
information about success, partial success, or failure result with
failure reasons. Otherwise, the rApp can query for the write
configuration changes job status and result with query procedures.

## 10.4 AI/ML workflow procedures

### 10.4.1 rApps register, discover AI/ML models, and subscribe to models changes

Figure 10.4.1-1 illustrates an example workflow of rApps using AI/ML
workflow functions to register, discover AI/ML models and subscribe to
registered models changes.

A model producer rApp sends a request to the AI/ML workflow functions to
register an AI/ML model. The register AI/ML model request contains AI/ML
model information (e.g., model accuracy, model usage scenario, model
training dataset information, etc.). Upon receipt of the registration
request, the AI/ML workflow functions authorize the model producer rApp
and register the AI/ML model. After successful registration, the AI/ML
workflow functions assign an AI/ML model registration identifier and
communicate this registration identifier to the model producer rApp in a
register AI/ML model response.

A model consumer rApp sends a request to the AI/ML workflow functions to
discover registered AI/ML models based on optional selection criteria.
After receiving the request, the AI/ML workflow functions authorize the
model consumer rApp and communicate to the model consumer rApp the model
identifier(s) and metadata of AI/ML model(s) that match the provided
selection criteria.

The model consumer rApp can send a subscribe AI/ML model change request
to the AI/ML workflow functions to subscribe to the changes in a
registered AI/ML model. Upon receipt of the subscription request, AI/ML
workflow functions authorize the model consumer rApp and create a
subscription. After successful subscription, the AI/ML workflow
functions communicate to the model consumer rApp the subscription ID in
a subscribe AI/ML model change response.

When there is a change in the subscribed AI/ML model, the AI/ML workflow
functions send notifications of changes in the registered AI/ML model to
the subscribed AI/ML model consumer rApp.

When the model producer rApp sends a deregister request to the AI/ML
workflow functions to deregister a registered AI/ML model, the AI/ML
workflow functions deregister the AI/ML model and communicate to the
rApp that the deregistration was successful. The AI/ML workflow
functions send notifications of the deregistration of the registered
AI/ML model to the subscribed AI/ML model consumer rApp.

The model consumer rApp can send an unsubscribe request to the AI/ML
workflow functions to unsubscribe to changes in a registered AI/ML
model. Upon reception of the unsubscribe request, the AI/ML workflow
functions unsubscribe the model consumer rApp to the AI/ML model change.
After successfully unsubscribing, the AI/ML workflow functions
communicate to the model consumer rApp that unsubscribing was
successful.

### 10.4.2 AI/ML training procedures

The following figures illustrate an example workflows of an AI/ML
training services Consumer rApp requesting AI/ML training of an AI/ML
model. In figure 10.4.2-1, the AI/ML workflow functions in the Non-RT
RIC framework are the AI/ML training services Producer. In figure
10.4.2-2, an AI/ML training services Producer rApp produces the AI/ML
training services. In figure 10.4.2-3, the AI/ML workflow functions
coordinate AI/ML training in the SMO/Non-RT RIC, and they relay training
request and subsequent messages between the AI/ML training services
Consumer App and a proper AI/ML training services Producer rApp based on
registered training capabilities.

The AI/ML training services Consumer rApp sends a training request to
the AI/ML training services Producer, providing model identifier of the
model to be trained, information about required data for training,
training requirements such as validation criteria, and a URI to receive
notifications, etc. The AI/ML training services Producer, if accepts the
training request, sends back request training response containing a
training identifier.

After accepting the training request, the AI/ML training services
Producer may retrieve the model from the model repository and consumes
training data via DME based on the information provided by the AI/ML
training services Consumer rApp. The AI/ML training services Producer
then performs the training.

The AI/ML training services Consumer rApp can query the training job
status using the received training job identifier. The AI/ML training
services Producer provides the training job status in the response to
the query.

If the AI/ML training services Consumer rApp wants to cancel the
on-going training, it sends a cancel training request to the AI/ML
training services Producer providing the training job identifier. The
AI/ML training services Producer then terminates the training and
response to the AI/ML training services Consumer rApp.

If the training completes, the AI/ML training services Producer may
store the trained model in the model repository, and it then notifies
the AI/ML training services Consumer rApp about the completion of the
training, sending the notification to the notification URI received in
the training request.

The AI/ML training services Consumer rApp can retrieve the trained model
from the model repository, if the AI/ML training services Producer has
stored the trained model in the model repository.

NOTE: The model repository can be implemented as part of the AI/ML
workflow functions.

### 10.4.3 AI/ML model storage and retrieval procedures

Figure 10.4.3-1 illustrates an example workflow of AI/ML model storage
and retrieval.

The AI/ML training services Consumer rApp sends training request to the
AI/ML training services Producer rApp. After accepting the training
request, the AI/ML training services Producer rApp may send a retrieve
model request to the AI/ML workflow functions, containing the model
identifier of the AI/ML model to be trained. The AI/ML workflow
functions validate the retrieval request and provide the model location
details of the requested AI/ML model. The AI/ML training services
Producer rApp may retrieve the model to be trained via the model
location details.

The AI/ML training services Producer rApp trains the AI/ML model. After
the completion of the model training, the AI/ML training services
Producer rApp may send store model request to the AI/ML workflow
functions to store the trained model. It provides the model identifier
and model location details for the trained model in the request. The
AI/ML workflow functions response to the storage request with an updated
identifier for the trained model.

The AI/ML training services Producer rApp notifies the AI/ML training
services Consumer rApp about the completion of the model training. The
AI/ML training services Consumer rApp then may send retrieve model
request to the AI/ML workflow functions with the updated model
identifier to retrieve the trained model. The AI/ML workflow functions
response to the retrieval request with the model location details of the
trained model.

# Annex A (informative): rApp LCM

## A.1 Overview

### A.1.1 Introduction

The application package model is specified in OAM Architecture \[i.3\]
clause 6, and the process of on-boarding is specified in O-RAN TS:
"Onboarding SMOS General Aspects and Principals" \[i.2\] clause 4. The
deployment, maintenance and termination of an rApp is described on high
level. The below clauses describe the detailed lifecycle aspects of a
rApp instances with an example of the rApp management functions.

### A.1.2 rApp LCM workflow

The rApp LCM consumer can initiate the deployment of an rApp instance by
requesting creation from the rApp management functions.

Once rApp management functions are aware that an rApp package is
on-boarded and stored in the on-boarding catalog as specified in O-RAN
TS: "Onboarding SMOS General Aspects and Principals" \[i.2\] clause 4,
the rApp management functions consume the rApp package artifacts, then
the rApp management functions initiate the deployment of rApp instances
in the run-time environment by creating the workloads.

When rApp instance is created, it makes an optional bootstrap request
(or uses configured service endpoints) and performs registrations via R1
(e.g., register as an rApp, register service APIs with SME, request
authorization, register data production capabilities with DME, or
register AI/ML model with AME) necessary for the rApp to execute
according to its configuration. The rApp then performs required R1
activities, e.g., creating required data jobs via DME services (e.g.,
for the input to the model inference) and activates data production as
requested via DME services (e.g., for output from model inferencing to
be used for actuations towards network functions).Once the rApp instance
is running , it can be managed over R1 interface via the rApp management
services as specified in clause 7.8.

Upgrading the rApp instance initiates the removal of the rApp instance
and deployment of a new instance of the rApp with the updated
configuration based on new or modified rApp package artifacts.

When the rApp instance is terminated, the rApp management functions
removes the rApp instance.

The rApp lifecycle management workflow is illustrated in figure A.1-1.

Figure A.1.2-1 rApp lifecycle management workflow.

#### A.1.2.1 Deployment of an rApp instance 

When all the artefacts have been onboarded, the rApp instance can be
deployed.

Figure A.1.2.1-1 Deploy rApp instance

1.  The rApp LCM consumer can request to create an rApp instance, the
    rApp management functions preform necessary registrations and
    associate the security details for creating the workload by
    providing the workload configuration.

2.  The rApp management functions responds to request for the creation
    of an rApp instance to the rApp LCM consumer.

When deployment is completed, the rApp instance starts being active over
the R1 interface.

NOTE 1: An rApp obtains during deployment security details that as
specified in O-RAN TS: "Security Requirements Specifications" \[i.4\]
clause 5.1.2.

#### A.1.2.2 Maintenance of an rApp instance 

##### A.1.2.2.1 Upgrade of an rApp instance

Changing the artefacts for the rApp instance is referred to as Upgrading
the rApp instance.

Before rApp instance can be upgraded, a new rApp package with the
new/modified artefacts must have been onboarded.

Figure A.1.2.2.1-1 Upgrade rApp instance

1.  An upgrade request is received containing a new configuration for
    the deployed rApp. The rApp LCM consumer initiates the upgrade of
    the instance.

2.  rApp management functions upgrade the rApp instance, the new
    workload configuration is consumed and the rApp instance is
    deployed.

3.  The rApp management functions responds to request for the upgrade of
    an rApp instance to the rApp LCM consumer.

#### A.1.2.3 Termination of an rApp instance

An rApp instance is terminated, by deleting the rApp instance. The rApp
LCM consumer can request the rApp management functions to delete the
rApp instance.
