# 4 General

## 4.1 Introduction

The present document contains the stage-3 definitions for the services
identified in Y1GAP \[1\]. Certain data types, including but not limited
to RAI data types are defined in Y1TD \[2\].

One or more solution sets in terms of network protocol and data
interchange format may be defined for each Y1 service API. The use of a
specific solution set for a Y1 service API may be preconfigured or
selected via negotiation mechanisms between the Near-RT RIC and the Y1
consumer.

## 4.2 Versioning of Y1 service APIs

### 4.2.1 General rules for API version

Each Y1 service API is versioned independently. An API version shall
consist of at least 3 fields, following a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern
according to the Semantic Versioning Specification \[i.2\] unless
specified otherwise.

EXAMPLE: \"1.0.0\".

The basic rules as reproduced from \[i.2\] shall apply for incrementing
the versions:

\- MAJOR version is incremented if backward incompatible change is made.

\- MINOR version is incremented if functional change is made in a
backward compatible way.

\- PATCH version is incremented if correction is made in a backward
compatible way.

### 4.2.2 Versioning for multiple solution sets of a Y1 service API

For a single Y1 service API in the present document, a single version
should be kept across all the solution sets defined for that API. That
means the different solution sets for a Y1 service API should evolve
simultaneously.

### 4.2.3 Versioning for certain data types

The Y1 service APIs are designed in the approach that certain data types
are decoupled from the APIs, and such data types may have versions
independent from the API version. To that end, the full compatibility
for a given solution set of a single Y1 service API between Near-RT RIC
and Y1 consumer is jointly governed by the API version and the relevant
data type version(s).

# 5 Usage of solution sets

## 5.1 Introduction

For each solution set, the generic designs are defined in this clause.

The solution sets that may be used for a Y1 service API are listed in
Table 5.1-1.

Table 5.1-1: Solution sets for Y1 interface

  Solution Set                      Clause
  --------------------------------- --------
  Solution 1: HTTP REST with JSON   5.2

## 5.2 Usage of HTTP REST with JSON

### 5.2.1 General

The solution set of HTTP REST with JSON is introduced in clause 7.2 of
Y1GAP \[1\].

The OpenAPI \[3\] specifications for each Y1 service API with this
solution set are documented in Annex A.

### 5.2.2 Content type

The bodies of HTTP request and successful HTTP responses shall be
encoded in JSON format. The MIME media type that shall be used within
the related Content-Type header field is \"application/json\", as
defined in IETF RFC 8259 \[4\], unless specified otherwise.

The \"Problem Details\" JSON object used to indicate additional details
of the error in a HTTP response body shall be signaled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 \[5\].

### 5.2.3 URI structure

#### 5.2.3.1 Resource URI structure

The resource URIs of all Y1 service APIs, unless specified otherwise,
shall be structured as:

> **{apiRoot}/\<apiName\>/\<apiMajorVersion\>/\<apiSpecificResourceUriPart\>**

with the following components:

\- The {apiRoot} indicates the scheme, the host name and optional port,
and an optional implementation-specific sequence of path segments
(starting with \"/\").

\- The \<apiName\> indicates the API name of the service API in an
abbreviated form. It is defined in the clause specifying the
corresponding Y1 service API.

\- The \<apiMajorVersion\> indicates the major version of the service
API (see clause 4.2.1) and is defined in the clause specifying the
corresponding Y1 service API.

\- Each \<apiSpecificResourceUriPart\> represents a specific resource of
the service API. It is defined in the clause specifying the
corresponding Y1 service API.

All resource URIs of the service APIs shall comply with the URI syntax
as defined in IETF RFC 3986 \[6\].

### 5.2.4 HTTP headers

#### 5.2.4.1 General

The HTTP headers used in \[7\] shall be supported by all Y1 service APIs
with the solution set \"HTTP REST with JSON\" in the present document,
unless specified otherwise.

### 5.2.5 Error handling

#### 5.2.5.1 General

Unless specified otherwise, the HTTP error handling mechanism described
in clause 5.2.6 of \[7\] shall be supported by all Y1 service APIs with
the solution set \"HTTP REST with JSON\" in the present document, with
the following replacements:

\- the SCEF is replaced by the Near-RT RIC; and

\- the SCS/AS is replaced by the Y1 consumer.

# 6 API Definitions

##### 6.2.2.1.2 RAI_Subscribe service operation

###### 6.2.2.1.2.1 General

The RAI_Subscribe service operation is used by a Y1 consumer to create
or update a subscription for RAI notifications from the Near-RT RIC.

###### 6.2.2.1.2.2 Subscribe to RAI notifications

Figure 6.2.2.1.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the Y1 consumer sends a
request to the Near-RT RIC to create a subscription to RAI
notifications. The operation is based on HTTP POST.

\@startuml

participant \"Y1 consumer\" as cons

participant \"Near-RT RIC\" as prod

height="1.5909722222222222in"}

Figure 6.2.2.1.2.2-1: Y1 consumer subscribes to notifications

The Y1 consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the Near-RT RIC with
the Resource URL
\"{apiRoot}/Y1_RAI_Subscription/\<apiMajorVersion\>/subscriptions\"
representing the \"All Y1 RAI Subscriptions\" resource, to create an
\"Individual Y1 RAI Subscription\" resource according to the information
in the message.

NOTE: The path segment \" Y1_RAI_Subscription\" does not follow the
related naming convention specified in clause 5.2.4.1 of \[7\]. The path
segment is however kept as currently defined in this specification for
backward compatibility considerations.

The \"RaiSubscription\" data structure provided in the request body
shall include:

\- the type of RAI as the \"raiType\" attribute;

\- the version of the RAI type as the \"raiTypeVersion\" attribute;

\- the target entity/entities of the RAI in the \"targetEntities\"
attribute;

\- an URI where to receive the RAI notifications as the
\"notificationTargetAddress\" attribute;

\- the timing or the events when the RAI notifications are triggered in
the \"notificationCriteria\" attribute, which shall include:

\- the method used to trigger RAI notifications as the
\"notificationMethod\" attribute;

\- the time interval between periodic RAI notifications as the
\"notificationPeriod\" attribute, if the \"notificationMethod\"

Figure 6.3.2.1.2.2-1: Y1 consumer query a RAI

The Y1 consumer shall send an HTTP GET request to the Near-RT RIC on the
resource URI \"{apiRoot}/Y1_RAI_Query/\<apiMajorVersion\>/analytics\"
representing the \"Y1 RAI\" resource, to request RAI.

NOTE: The path segment \" Y1_RAI_Query \" does not follow the related
naming convention specified in clause 5.2.4.1 of \[7\]. The path segment
is however kept as currently defined in this specification for backward
compatibility considerations.

The following information shall be provided:

\- the type of RAI as the \"raiType\" attribute;

\- the version of the RAI type as the \"raiTypeVersion\" attribute;

\- the target entity/entities of the RAI in the \"targetEntities\"
attribute.

The following information may be provided:

\- the expected validity period(s) for the RAI in the
\"expectedValidityPeriods\" attribute; an expected validity period
before the occurrence of a RAI query refers to statistics for a past
time, and an expected validity period after the occurrence of a RAI
query refers to a prediction for a future time.

\- the filter parameters to filter RAI contents in the RAI report as the
\"filterParameters\" attribute;

Upon the reception of the HTTP GET request, the Near-RT RIC shall
analyse RAI according to the request.

If the HTTP request message from the Y1 consumer is accepted, the
Near-RT RIC shall respond with \"200 OK\" status code with the message
body containing the RAI with parameters as relevant for the requesting
Y1 consumer. The \"raiQueryResult\" data structure in the response body
shall include:

\- the RAI reports in the \"raiReports\" attribute that, for each RAI
report, the \"RaiReport\" data type shall include:

\- the target entity of the RAI report as the \"targetEntity\"
attribute;

\- the validity period of the RAI report as the \"validityPeriod\"
attribute;

\- the actual RAI contents as the \"raiContents\" attribute;

and may include:

\- the confidence of the RAI report, if the RAI report is a prediction;

\- the timestamp when Near-RT RIC generates the RAI report as the
\"timeStampRaiGeneration\" attribute.

If an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the Near-RT
RIC shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.2.2.6. In
particular,

\- If the necessary data to perform the analysis are unavailable, the
Near-RT RIC shall reject the request with a \"500 Internal Server
Error\" status code and a \"ProblemDetails\" data structure including
the \"cause\" attribute set to \"DATA_UNAVAILABLE\".

#### 6.3.2.2 Resources

##### 6.3.2.2.1 Resource URI structure

The resource URI shall have the structure as defined in clause 5.2.3.1
with the following clarifications:

\- The \<apiName\> shall be \"Y1_RAI_Query\".

\- The \<apiMajorVersion\> shall be \"v1\".

\- The \<apiSpecificResourceUriPart\> shall be set as illustrated in
figure 6.3.2.2.1-1.
