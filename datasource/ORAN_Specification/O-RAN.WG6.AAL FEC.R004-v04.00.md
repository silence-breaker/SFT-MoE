# 5 AALi Configuraton and Management 

The chapter defines the common configuration and management aspects of
the AALi as they relate to the AAL_PUSCH_FEC and AAL_PDSCH_FEC profiles.
The AALi configuration and management APIs are the API's that an AAL
application (O-DU) executes to configure and manage the AAL-LPU(s) that
have been allocated to the application by the O-Cloud.

The below section describes the requirements of the AALi presented to

# 6 AAL Profile Specifications

## 6.1 Profile Specifications Overview 

This section contains information for each supported AAL profile . A
profile may provide several APIs for specific profile configuration in
addition to the general AAL configuration APIs. Profile specific
configuration shall be applied on a per queue basis and only for
functionality that cannot be changed at run time. Each profile shall
define a capabilities list that will be used to define the operations
supported by the AAL-LPU.

### 6.1.1 Operation Representation 

Operations offloaded to the AAL-LPU are represented by a single
operation context that shall include all necessary information required
by the AAL Implementation to process the operation.

The operation context defines the operation type as supported by the AAL
Profile. It includes an operation status, a reference to the operation
specific data, which can vary in size and content depending on the
operation/profile being provisioned. Application software is responsible
for specifying all the operation-specific fields that are then used by
the AAL-LPU to process the requested operation.

Scheduling of AAL operations on an application data path is performed
using a burst oriented asynchronous API set. A queue on an AAL-LPU
accepts a burst of operations (1 to N number of operations) using
enqueue API. The enqueue API will place the operations to be processed
on the AAL-LPU's hardware input. The dequeue API will retrieve any
processed operations available from the queue on the AAL-LPU.

### 6.1.2 Profile Capabaillities 

Each Profile has a set of capabilities which capture the functions
supported by each implementation. This includes optional features such a
interrupts and debug interfaces. The AAL shall provide an API to report
the capabilities of the underlying AAL implementation as per clause
5.2.2.

### 6.1.3 Memory Management

The AAL Implementation shall provide any profile specific memory
management (examples allocate and free memory) as required by the AAL
Implementation.

## 6.2 O-DU AAL PDSCH FEC Profile Specification

As per O-RAN AAL GAnP document \[7\] the PDSCH FEC Profile shall support

-   CRC Generation

-   LDPC Encoding

-   PDSCH Rate Matching

### 6.2.1 AAL FEC PDSCH Profile Capabilities 

The AAL FEC PDSCH Profile interface shall support operations on both a
code block (CB) and a transport block (TB) basis.

An operation can be performed on one CB at a time \"CB-mode\". An
operation can be performed on one or multiple CBs that logically belong
to a TB \"TB-mode\". The input data is the CB or TB input to the
encoder. The output data is the ratematched CB or TB data.

The input and output buffers shall be allocated by the application
according to 6.1.3.

The input buffer shall contain the input code block or transport block
data the operation is to be performed on.

The output buffer is mandatory and is the encoded CB(s). In CB-mode it
contains the encoded CB of size e (E in 3GPP TS 38.212 section 6.2.5).
In TB-mode it contains multiple contiguous encoded CBs of size ea or eb.
The output buffer is allocated by the application with enough room for
the output data.

The following modes of operation shall be supported:

CB-mode: one CB (with CRC24B appended to the output buffer if required)

CB-mode: one CB making up one TB (with CRC16 or CRC24A appended to the
output buffer if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB of a partial TB (with CRC24B(s) appended to the
output buffer if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB of a complete TB (with CRC16, CRC24A and
CRC24B(s) appended to the output buffer if required)

The AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile shall list the CRC's supported in its
capabilities. The AAL Implementation of the AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile shall
provide the flexibility for the application to configure the operation
in CB-mode with application selected CRC type and TB-mode with
application selected CRC type.

In CB-mode an application can select whether CRC24A is appended to the
CB or not. If configured not to append CRC24A then the application not
the AAL Implementation, shall calculate and append CRC24A before calling
AAL. The input data length is inclusive of CRC24A/B where present and is
equal to the code block size K'. Note that code block length will always
be a multiple of 8 and it is assumed that there are 8 bits packed into
each byte.

In TB-mode, the input data length shall equal the total size of the CBs
inclusive of any CRC24A and CRC24B..

In the case of a partial TB the AAL Application shall provide the index
of the first CB in the group of CBs and the number of CBs in the group..

The number of CBs in the group should not be confused with c, the total
number of CBs in the full TB (C as per 3GPP TS 38.212 section 5.2.2).

When using CB-mode, concatentation of the output code blocks into a
transport block, is not performaned by the AAL Implementation.

The AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile capabilities shall be reported to the
application as per Table 5.2.2-1: AAL-LPU Capabilities . The
AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile capabilities are defined in Table 6.1.1.1-1:
AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile Capabilities, these capabilities shall be reported
to the application andmay not be implemented by the AALi implementation.

## 6.3 O-DU AAL PUSCH FEC Profile Specification 

This section defines the AAL PUSCH FEC Profile specification. As per
O-RAN AAL GAnP document \[7\] the AAL_PUSCH_FEC Profile shall upport the
following functions

-   PUSCH Rate De-matching

-   LDPC Decoder

-   CRC Check

NOTE: the AAL_PUSCH_FEC Profile only supports PUSCH Forward Error
Correction. It shall not include support for PUSCH UCI

### 6.3.1 AAL FEC PUSCH Profile Capabilities 

The decode operations are invoked through enqueue and dequeue functions.
The operation context defines the parameters used to configure the
operation to be accelerated. These parameters are defined in 6.3.2.

The input and output buffers shall be allocated by the application
according to 6.1.3.The input buffer shall contain the encoded CB data to
be decoded and is the Virtual Circular Buffer data stream with null
padding. Each byte in the input circular buffer is the LLR value of each
bit of the original CB.

The output buffer shall contain the hard_output which is the decoded CBs
of size K' (CRC24A/B or CRC16 is the last 24bit or 16bits in each
decoded CB. The AAL Implementation shall give the option to drop the
CRC. Where CRC Drop is set then the CRC will not be present at the end
of the buffer). In transport block mode the hard_output will contain the
decoded transport block.

The AAL Implementation may support the optional soft output buffer which
is an LLR rate matched output of size e (this is E as per 3GPP TS 38.212
section 6.2.5).

The AAL Implementation may support optional harq input buffer which is a
buffer with the input to the HARQ combination function. If the AAL-LPU
supports internal memory capability and is enabled, then the HARQ shall
be stored in the AAL-LPU internal memory and shall not visible to the
application.

The AAL Implementation may support the optional HARQ Combined output
which is a buffer for the output of the HARQ combination function of the
AAL-LPU. If the AAL-LPU supports internal memory capability and is
enabled, then the HARQ is stored in memory internal to the AAL-LPU and
not visible to application.

As with the AAL PDSCH FEC Profile, the decode interface works on both a
code block (CB) and a transport block (TB) basis.

The following modes of operation shall be supported:

CB-mode: one CB (CRC24B if required)

CB-mode: one CB making up one TB (CRC16 or CRC24A if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB making up a partial TB (CRC24B(s) if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB making up a complete TB (CRC16, CRC24A and
CRC24B(s) if required)

The buffer length is inclusive of CRC24A/B where present and is equal
the code block size K'.

The first CB Virtual Circular Buffer (VCB) index is given by r but the
number of the remaining CB VCBs shall be calculated by the AAL
implementation.

The input buffer length shall equal the total size of the CBs inclusive
of any CRC24A and CRC24B in case they were appended by the application.

#### 6.3.1.1 LLR Compression 

The AAL PUSCH FEC Profile may support compression of the LLR bits used
for the HARQ data. This improves PCIE memory bandwidth and memory
storage. LLR compression support shall be reported through the AAL to
the application..

#### 6.3.1.2 Summary of AAL_PUSCH_FEC Profile capabilities 

Table 6.3.1.2-1 lists the AAL_PUSCH_FEC profile capabilities that shall
be reported to the application.

##  6.4 AAL Profile API Definitions 

O-RAN and the O-RAN Software Community\[7\] has published a normative
definition of the AAL FEC API's. The AAL FEC API definitions are based
on the WG6 AAL FEC profile requirements in \[7\] and this document.
Refer to AAL Repository \[9\] in the OSC for APIs decription details.
This current version uses the git tag version
oran_e\_maintenance_release_v1.0

### 6.4.1 O-RAN AAL FEC API Terminology 

The O-RAN AAL FEC API definition is based on DPDK, as such the naming
convention and coding styles follow DPDK guidelines \[i2\]. This section
gives an overview of the DPDK terminology mapping to the profile
specification\[9\].
