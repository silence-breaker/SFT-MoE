### 7.3.2 Event Trigger Style 1: Periodic Report

Event Trigger style 1 shall set the KPM report period and uses the *RIC
Event Trigger Definition* IE Format 1 (see clause 8.2.1.1.1)

### 7.3.3 Event Trigger Style 2: Measurement Event

Event Trigger style 2 is used to configure event-based reporting based
on measurement data. Each event condition is defined using
measurement-based or value-based parameters, and is evaluated based on
the availability of measurement samples. If the *Event Evaluation
Period* IE is included, the event condition is evaluated periodically
according to the configured evaluation period. Otherwise, it is
continuously evaluated whenever a new measurement sample becomes
available for the associated parameters. The E2 Node can be configured
with multiple event conditions simultaneously and triggered to send KPM
reports when all the configured events happen or for any logical
combination of events.

> Example For a window-average of three measurement samples of a
> specific measurement associated with a cell to be compared against a
> threshold integer value and triggered when exceeding the threshold,
> the *Event Condition* IE in 8.2.1.1.2 can be defined as follows:

-   The *Event Left Expression* IE contains only one parameter and
    > selects the *Parameter Type* IE as "Measurement", where the
    > *Measurement Definition* IE specifies the measurement and the
    > associated cell via 8.3.33, and the corresponding *Window
    > Definition* IE configures a window size of three with its
    > aggregation function set to \"avg\".

-   The *Event Logical Operator* IE is set to \"greaterthan\".

-   The *Event Right Expression* IE contains only one parameter and
    > selects the *Parameter Type* IE as "Value", where the *Test Value*
    > IE is assigned to the threshold integer value.

> Example For a sum of two different measurements (each from measurement
> type 1 and type 2, respectively) associated with a cell to be compared
> against a window-average of five measurement samples of a measurement
> type 3 associated with the same cell, and triggered when exceeding the
> window-averaged value, the *Event Condition* IE in 8.2.1.1.2 can be
> defined as follows:

-   The *Event Left Expression* IE contains two parameters and selects
    > the first *Parameter Type* IE as "Measurement", where the
    > *Measurement Definition* IE specifies the measurement type 1 and
    > the associated cell via 8.3.33 while the corresponding *Window
    > Definition* IE is absent.

-   The *Event Left Expression* IE also selects the second *Parameter
    > Type* IE as "Measurement", where the *Measurement Definition* IE
    > specifies the measurement type 2 and the associated cell via
    > 8.3.33 while the corresponding *Window Definition* IE is absent.
    > The *Event Left Expression* IE also includes the *Aggregation
    > Function* IE set to "sum".

-   The *Event Logical Operator* IE is set to \"greaterthan\".

-   The *Event Right Expression* IE contains only one parameter and
    > selects the *Parameter Type* IE as "Measurement", where the
    > *Measurement Definition* IE specifies the measurement type 3 and
    > the associated cell via 8.3.33, and the corresponding *Window
    > Definition* IE configures a window size of five with its
    > aggregation function set to \"avg\".

For any measurement-based parameter used in an event condition defined
by the *RIC Event Trigger Definition* IE, the corresponding measurement
must be subscribed by the *RIC Action Definition* IE in the same RIC
SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message from the Near-RT RIC.

In this version of the specification, a measurement-based parameter
associated with a specific UE is not supported.

This *RIC Event Trigger Definition* IE style uses *RIC Event Trigger
Definition* IE Format 2 (8.2.1.1.2).

### 7.4.2 REPORT Service Style 1: E2 Node Measurement

#### 7.4.2.1 REPORT Service Style description

REPORT Service style 1 provides the performance measurement information
collection from an E2 Node.

#### 7.4.2.2 REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE contents

REPORT Service style 1 aims to subscribe to the measurements defined in
TS 28.552 \[4\] and TS 32.425 \[8\], and shall use the *RIC Action
Definition* IE Format 1 (see clause 8.2.1.2.1).

REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE Format 1 contains measurement
types that Near-RT RIC is requesting to subscribe followed by a list of
subcounters to be measured for each measurement type, and a granularity
period indicating collection interval of those measurements. For a
certain measurement type to be subscribed, the *Matching Condition for
Reporting* IE may also be included to give conditions for the E2 Node in
reporting measurements, to report a measured value corresponding to that
measurement type only when the value satisfies the given conditions.

For the measurement types that belong to a measurement object class
confined in a single cell (e.g. \"EUtranCellFDD\" in TS 32.425 \[8\] or
\"NRCellDU\" in TS 28.552 \[4\]), the *Cell Global ID* IE shall be
included in the IE to point to a specific cell for collecting
measurements within the E2 Node. The *Cell Global ID* IE shall not be
included if all the subscribed measurement types are cell agnostic, i.e.
belonging to measurement object classes not confined in a single cell
(e.g. \"GNBCUUPFunction\" in TS 28.552 \[4\]). In case that both
single-cell-confined and cell agnostic measurement types are subscribed
together, the *Cell Global ID* IE shall be included in the IE and the E2
Node shall ignore the included *Cell Global ID* IE for those cell
agnostic measurement types.

A measurement ID can be used for subscription instead of a measurement
type if an identifier of a certain measurement type was exposed by an E2
Node via the *RAN Function Definition* IE.

#### 7.4.2.3 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Header* IE contents

REPORT Service style 1 shall use the *RIC Indication Header* IE Format 1
(see clause 8.2.1.3.1), which contains a measurement collection start
time as UTC format.

REPORT Service *RIC Indication Header* IE Format 1 may carry file format
version, sender name, sender type, and vendor name as printable strings.

#### 7.4.2.4 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Message* IE contents

REPORT Service style 1 shall use the *RIC Indication Message* IE Format
1 (see clause 8.2.1.4.1).

REPORT Service *RIC Indication Message* IE Format 1 carries a set of
measurement data reported from an E2 Node. The reported data contains a
set of measurement records, each collected at every granularity period
during the reporting period. In case that the *Matching Condition for
Reporting* IE has been configured in the *RIC Action Definition* IE for
a measurement type and a measured value corresponding to that
measurement type in a granularity period did not satisfy the configured
reporting condition, the E2 Node shall indicate "Not Satisfied" instead
of reporting the actual measured value within the measurement record
corresponding to that granularity period. In case the configured
reporting condition(s) are not satisfied entirely for a reporting period
for all the subscribed measurement types, the E2 Node may omit sending
the report for this reporting period. In case the E2 Node is not able to
provide reliable data for a granularity period during the reporting
period, it may include the optional *Incomplete Flag* IE, which
indicates that the corresponding measurements record in the reported
data is not reliable.

REPORT Service *RIC Indication Message* IE Format 1 may carry
subscription information, i.e. *Measurement Information List* IE that
indicates the order of measured values for each measurement record in
the reported data, or their granularity period. If not present, the
original subscription information shall apply.

### 7.4.3 REPORT Service Style 2: E2 Node Measurement for a single UE

#### 7.4.3.1 REPORT Service Style description

REPORT Service style 2 provides the performance measurement information
collection for a single UE of interest from an E2 Node.

#### 7.4.3.2 REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE contents

REPORT Service style 2 shall use the *RIC Action Definition* IE Format 2
(see clause 8.2.1.2.2), where the included UE ID indicates a specific UE
of interest for measurement collection.

The rest of the subscription information follows the same as described
in 7.4.2.2.

#### 7.4.3.3 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Header* IE contents

REPORT Service style 2 shall use the *RIC Indication Header* IE Format 1
(see clause 8.2.1.3.1) as described in 7.4.2.3.

#### 7.4.3.4 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Message* IE contents

REPORT Service style 2 shall use the *RIC Indication Message* IE Format
1 (see clause 8.2.1.4.1) as described in 7.4.2.4, where the measurement
data reported is associated only to a specific UE that was subscribed.

### 7.4.4 REPORT Service Style 3: Condition-based, UE-level E2 Node Measurement

#### 7.4.4.1 REPORT Service Style description

REPORT Service style 3 provides the UE-level performance measurement
information collection for a group of UEs per measurement type matching
subscribed conditions from an E2 Node.

#### 7.4.4.2 REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE contents

REPORT Service style 3 shall use the *RIC Action Definition* IE Format 3
(see clause 8.2.1.2.3), where, for each requested measurement within the
*Measurement Information Condition List* IE, the *Matching Condition* IE
serves as a condition to include the matched UEs' measurement values
into the reporting. The *Matching Condition* IE can be expressed by a
list of subcounters to be measured (i.e. as a list of labels), or by a
list of test conditions that need to be passed, or by a combination of
both.

The rest of the subscription information follows the same as described
in 7.4.2.2.

#### 7.4.4.3 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Header* IE contents

REPORT Service style 3 shall use the *RIC Indication Header* IE Format 1
(see clause 8.2.1.3.1) as described in 7.4.2.3.

#### 7.4.4.4 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Message* IE contents

REPORT Service style 3 shall use the *RIC Indication Message* IE Format
2 (see clause 8.2.1.4.2).

REPORT Service *RIC Indication Message* IE Format 2 carries a set of
UE-level measurement data matching subscribed conditions. The included
*Measurement Information Condition UE List* IE indicates the order of
measured values for each measurement record in the reported data -- a
list of all the UE ID(s) satisfying the subscribed *Matching Condition*
IE for each requested measurement within a Reporting Period.

In every granularity period during which a UE matching a subscribed
condition stays in the E2 Node and maintains the RRC_CONNECTED or
RRC_INACTIVE state, the E2 Node shall collect the related data and
reports it at the end of the reporting period.

The *List of matched UE IDs* IE for a certain measurement type in the
*Measurement Information Condition UE List* IE indicates all the UE
ID(s) that satisfied the subscribed *Matching Condition* IE for that
measurement type and maintained the RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state
at least for one granularity period during the reporting period. The
*List of matched UE IDs* IE can be omitted for a certain subscribed
measurement type if none of the UEs were matched during the reporting
period. If the *List of matched UE IDs* IE is used for a measurement
type, then the same IE shall be used for all the measurement types in
the *Measurement Information Condition UE List* IE.

If the *List of matched UE IDs* IE is used, in the granularity periods
where the UE does not appear in the RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state
(e.g. transitioned to RRC_IDLE or UE identity track is lost), the E2
Node shall not collect the related data and NULL shall be reported for
those granularity periods until the end of the Reporting Period. In this
case, the E2 Node shall stop reporting measurements related to this UE
in the subsequent reporting periods. If the *List of matched UE IDs* IE
is used and a UE whose ID is included in the IE appeared in the middle
of the reporting period, then NULL shall be reported for the granularity
periods priori to the UE appearing in the E2 Node.

On the other hand, the *Sequence of Matched UE IDs for Granularity
Periods* IE for a certain measurement type in the *Measurement
Information Condition UE List* IE can be used to indicate the UE ID(s)
that satisfied the subscribed *Matching Condition* IE for the
corresponding measurement type and maintained the RRC_CONNECTED or
RRC_INACTIVE state, separately for each and every granularity period in
chronological order. If the *Sequence of Matched UE IDs for Granularity
Periods* IE is used for a measurement type, then the same IE shall be
used for all the measurement types in the *Measurement Information
Condition UE List* IE, and the *List of matched UE IDs* IE, if included
for any measurement type, shall be ignored.

The rest of the information follows the same as described in 7.4.2.4.

### 7.4.5 REPORT Service Style 4: Common condition-based, UE-level Measurement

#### 7.4.5.1 REPORT Service Style description

REPORT Service style 4 provides the UE-level performance measurement
information collection for a group of UEs across a set of measurement
types matching common subscribed conditions from an E2 Node.

#### 7.4.5.2 REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE contents

REPORT Service style 4 shall use the *RIC Action Definition* IE Format 4
(see clause 8.2.1.2.4), where a *Matching Condition* IE serves as a
condition to include the matched UEs' measurement values into the
reporting, common for each requested measurement within the *Measurement
Information List* IE. The *Matching Condition* IE is expressed by a list
of test conditions to filter matching UEs.

The rest of the subscription information follows the same as described
in 7.4.2.2.

#### 7.4.5.3 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Header* IE contents

REPORT Service style 4 shall use the *RIC Indication Header* IE Format 1
(see clause 8.2.1.3.1) as described in 7.4.2.3.

#### 7.4.5.4 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Message* IE contents

REPORT Service style 4 shall use the *RIC Indication Message* IE Format
3 (see clause 8.2.1.4.3).

REPORT Service *RIC Indication Message* IE Format 3 carries a list of
measurement data for UE(s) matching subscribed conditions.

In every granularity period during which a UE matching a subscribed
condition stays in the E2 Node and maintains the RRC_CONNECTED or
RRC_INACTIVE state, the E2 Node shall collect the related data and
report it at the end of the reporting period. In the granularity periods
where the UE does not appear in the RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state
(e.g. transitioned to RRC_IDLE or UE identity track is lost), the E2
Node shall not collect the related data and NULL shall be reported for
those granularity periods until the end of the Reporting Period. In this
case, the E2 Node shall stop reporting measurements related to this UE
in the subsequent reporting periods.

If none of the UEs were matched during the reporting period, then E2
Node shall not report measurements for that reporting period.

The rest of the information follows the same as described in 7.4.2.4.

### 7.4.6 REPORT Service Style 5: E2 Node Measurement for Multiple UEs

#### 7.4.6.1 REPORT Service Style description

REPORT Service style 5 provides the performance measurement information
collection for multiple UEs of interest from an E2 Node.

#### 7.4.6.2 REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE contents

REPORT Service style 5 shall use the *RIC Action Definition* IE Format 5
(see clause 8.2.1.2.5), where the included UE Identifiers indicates UEs
of interest for measurement collection.

The rest of the subscription information follows the same as described
in 7.4.2.2.

#### 7.4.6.3 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Header* IE contents

REPORT Service style 5 shall use the *RIC Indication Header* IE Format 1
(see clause 8.2.1.3.1) as described in 7.4.2.3.

#### 7.4.6.4 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Message* IE contents

REPORT Service style 5 shall use the *RIC Indication Message* IE Format
3 (see clause 8.2.1.4.3) as described in 7.4.5.4, where the measurement
data reported is associated to multiple UEs that was subscribed and
available in the system.

### 7.4.7 REPORT Service Style 255: Multiple report measurements

#### 7.4.7.1 REPORT Service Style description

REPORT Service style 255 provides support for the integration of
multiple report jobs into a single report action from an E2 Node.

This REPORT Service style provides a mechanism to initiate multiple
report action jobs of the selected fundamental level REPORT Service
style(s) that should be processed in an integrated manner by the E2
Node, i.e. the RIC Subscription procedure is considered failed if at
least one of the indicated report actions is unsuccessfully subscribed,
and RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message shall be sent containing the
appropriate error cause.

The resulting measurement reports may be either transmitted as an
integrated single Report message consisting of a list of individual job
specific Report messages or as individual Report messages each
corresponding to a single job in the list defined in the *RIC Action
Definition* IE.

#### 7.4.7.2 REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE contents

REPORT Service style 255 shall use *E2SM-KPM Action Definition Format
255* IE (see clause 8.2.1.2.6).

This REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE contains a list of jobs,
each associated with a unique *Job ID* IE. For each requested job, the
*Job Specific Action Definition* IE corresponding to one of the Action
Definition Formats of the fundamental level REPORT Services may be
included. The *Common Action Definition* IE, if included, shall apply
for a job where the corresponding *Job Specific Action Definition* IE is
absent. In other words, the *Common Action Definition* IE shall be
included, if at least one job does not have the corresponding *Job
Specific Action Definition* IE configured. In this case, one or more
optional job specific configuration IEs (*Job Specific Cell Global ID*
IE, *Job Specific UE ID* IE, *Job Specific List of Subscribed UE IDs*
IE) may also be included for such job, depending on which Action
Definition Format of the fundamental level REPORT Services is configured
for the *Common Action Definition* IE.

The following table presents the applicable report styles for each job
specific IEs:

  **Job specific IE**                           **Applicable Fundamental level Report Style**   **E2SM-KPM Action Definition Format**                                                                                        **Applicable IE**

  *Job Specific List of Subscribed UE IDs* IE   5                                               E2SM-KPM Action Definition Format 5                                                                                          *List of Subscribed UE IDs* IE

This REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE may also include the
*Reporting Approach* IE to indicate if the resulting RIC Indication
message shall carry a single report integrating multiple job results, or
if each job result should be reported independently via a separate RIC
Indication message at each event trigger.

> Example The *Common Action Definition* IE corresponding to the
> E2SM-KPM Action Definition Format 1 is included, with different *Job
> Specific Cell Global ID* IE for each requested job in the *List of
> Multi Report Action Definitions* IE. In this case, each job is
> initiated according to the fundamental level REPORT Service Style 1,
> with the *Cell Global ID* IE replaced by the *Job Specific Cell Global
> ID* IE configured for each job.

#### 7.4.7.3 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Header* IE contents

REPORT Service style 255 shall use the *RIC Indication Header* IE Format
1 (see clause 8.2.1.3.1) as described in 7.4.2.3.

The *Job ID* IE shall be included if the *Reporting Approach* IE is
included in this REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE and set to
"Single Integrated".

#### 7.4.7.4 REPORT Service *RIC Indication Message* IE contents

REPORT Service style 255 shall use the *E2SM-KPM Indication Message* IE
Format 255 (see clause 8.2.1.4.4) if the *Reporting Approach* IE is
included in this REPORT Service *RIC Action Definition* IE and set to
"Single Integrated". In this case, the message carries a sequence of
*RIC Indication Message* IE for each job identified by the *Job ID* IE,
carrying the job result formatted according to the associated
fundamental level REPORT Service specific *RIC Indication Message* IE.

If the *Reporting Approach* IE is included in this REPORT Service *RIC
Action Definition* IE and set to "Multiple Individually", the *E2SM-KPM
Indication Message* IE Format 255 shall not be used. For each job
result, an individual RIC Indication message shall be sent, formatted
according to the associated fundamental level REPORT Service specific
*RIC Indication Message* IE.

In all cases, the individual measurements and measurement records are
ordered according to the definition in the applicable fundamental level
REPORT Service style.

  ------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  a\) Description                This measurement provides the fraction of RLC SDU packets which are dropped on the downlink, due to high traffic load, traffic management etc in the gNB-DU. Only user-plane traffic (DTCH) is considered. A dropped packet is one without any part of it having been transmitted on the air interface. The measurement is optionally split into subcounters per QoS level (mapped 5QI or QCI in EN-DC), and subcounters per supported S-NSSAI.
  b\) Collection Method          SI
  c\) Condition                  This attribute is created by counting the number of UEs experiencing a certain packet loss rate in each range.
  d\) Measurement Result         Each measurement is an integer value representing the drop rate multiplied by 1E6 of each UE within the range of the bin. The number of measurements is equal to one. If the optional QoS and S-NSSAI level measurement are performed, the measurements are equal to the number of mapped 5QIs and the number of supported S-NSSAIs.
  e\) Measurement Type           The measurement name has the form DRB.RlcPacketDropRateDLDist and optionally DRB.RlcPacketDropRateDLDist.QOS where QOS identifies the target quality of service class, and DRB.RlcPacketDropRateDLDist.SNSSAI where SNSSAI identifies the S-NSSAI.

## 8.3 Information Element definitions

### 8.3.1 General

When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit
strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics
description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle
applies with regards to the ordering of bits:

> \- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit
> (MSB);
>
> \- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit
> (LSB);
>
> \- When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit
> of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.

## 8.4 Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)

### 8.4.1 General

E2SM-KPM ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.680 \[5\] and ITU-T
Rec. X.681 \[6\].

Sub clause 8.4.2 presents the Abstract Syntax of the E2SM information
elements to be carried within the E2AP \[3\] protocol messages with
ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in
this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 8.2 and 8.3, the
ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for
the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall
take precedence.

If an E2SM information element carried as an OCTET STRING in an E2AP
\[3\] message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be
handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 9.

# Annex A (normative or informative): Further information on RAN Function Network KPM Monitor 

## A.1 Background Information

The RAN function "Key Performance Measurement" is used to provide RIC
Service exposure of the performance measurement logical function of the
E2 Nodes. Based on the O-RAN deployment architecture, available
measurements could be different. Figure A.1-1 shows the target
deployment architecture for E2SM-KPM.

height="3.5208333333333335in"}Figure A.1-1 E2SM-KPM Architecture

For each logical function the E2 Node shall use the RAN Function
Definition IE to declare the list of available measurements and a set of
supported RIC Services (**REPORT**).
