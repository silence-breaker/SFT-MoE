# 4 E2 interface architecture

## 4.1 General architecture principles

The general principles guiding the definition of the E2 interface
between Near-RT RIC and E2 Nodes are the following:

\- Near-RT RIC and E2 Node functions are fully separated from transport
functions. Addressing scheme used in Near-RT RIC and the E2 Nodes shall
not be tied to the addressing schemes of transport functions.

\- The E2 Nodes support all protocol layers and interfaces defined
within 3GPP radio access networks that include eNB for E-UTRAN, 3GPP TS
36.300 \[25\] and 3GPP TS 36.401 \[5\], and gNB/ ng-eNB for NG-RAN, 3GPP
TS 38.300 \[16\] and 3GPP TS 38.401 \[6\].

\- Near-RT RIC may use the set of RIC Services that are exposed by an E2
Node.

\- E2 Node may use the set of RIC Services that are exposed by the
Near-RT RIC.

\- The E2 Node shall describe the available RIC Services using a series
of RAN function and Radio Access Technology (RAT) dependent \"E2 Service
Models\".

\- E2 interfaces are defined along the following principles:

\- Interfaces are based on a logical model of the entity controlled
through this interface.

\- One physical network element can implement multiple logical nodes.

## 4.2 O-RAN architecture considerations

The Near-RT RIC and E2 Nodes connected by the E2 interface, as presented
in Figure 4.2-1, are part of the overall O-RAN Architecture O-RAN
WG1.TS.OAD \[18\].

[]{#_Toc184217355 .anchor}Figure 4.2-1: O-RAN architecture overview
showing Near-RT RIC interfaces

With respect to the E2 interface:

\- E2 is a logical interface connecting the Near-RT RIC with an E2 Node:

\- The Near-RT RIC is connected to the O-CU-CP;

\- The Near-RT RIC is connected to the O-CU-UP;

\- The Near-RT RIC is connected to the O-DU;

\- The Near-RT RIC is connected to the O-eNB.

\- An E2 Node is connected to only one Near-RT RIC.

\- A Near-RT RIC can be connected to multiple E2 Nodes, i.e. multiple
O-CU-CPs, O-CU-UPs, O-DUs and O-eNBs.

\- F1 (F1-C, F1-U) and E1 are logical 3GPP interfaces, whose protocols,
termination points and cardinalities are specified in NG-RAN, 3GPP TS
38.401 \[6\].

The Near-RT RIC use E2 interface to collect near real-time information
(e.g. UE basis, Cell basis) and provide value added services.

The protocols over E2 interface are based exclusively on Control plane
protocols and are defined in O-RAN WG3.TS.E2AP \[2\].

# 5 E2 interface

## 5.1 E2 interface requirements and general principles

### 5.1.1 E2 interface requirements

The E2 interface shall support the following requirements:

\- E2 interface requirements and general principes shall comply with the
general O-RAN architecture principles specified in O-RAN WG1.TS.OAD
\[18\].

\- E2 interface shall uniquely identify each E2 Node configured to
directly provide RIC Services to the Near-RT RIC.

\- A given Near-RT RIC may support E2 connections from multiple E2
Nodes, each supporting a specific RAT type.

\- E2 interface shall expose from the E2 Node a list of RAN Functions
supporting RIC Services and the corresponding E2 Service Model.

\- E2 interface shall allow the Near-RT RIC to address specific RAN
Functions in a specific E2 Node.

\- E2 node shall function independently of the Near-RT RIC when and if
the E2 interface and/or Near-RT RIC fails.

\- E2 interface shall support latency requirements for near-real-time
optimization, i.e. from 10 milliseconds up to 1 second as specified in
O-RAN WG1.TS.OAD \[18\].

\- RAN Functions supported over E2 interface shall be subject to the
capability of the E2 Node exposed over the E2 interface by means of the
E2 Service Model.

\- E2 Service Model shall describe the RAN Functions in the E2 Node that
may be optimized by the Near RT RIC.

\- For a RAN Function exposed in the E2 Service Model, the Near-RT RIC
may e.g. monitor, override or control via policies the behaviour of E2
node.

### 5.1.2 E2 interface general principles

The general principles for the specification of the E2 interface are as
follows:

\- E2 interface is open;

\- E2 interface supports the exchange of control signalling information
between the endpoints;

\- E2 is a point-to-point interface between the endpoints on Near-RT RIC
and E2 Node;

\- E2 interface definition supports interface management procedures
based on principles from 3GPP RAN interfaces;

\- E2 interface provides the capability to send predefined information
towards the Near-RT RIC based on a pre-configured trigger event;

\- E2 interface supports the ability to provide UE ID information
towards the Near-RT RIC based on a pre-configured trigger event;

\- E2 interface enables the Near-RT-RIC to direct the E2 Node to
interrupt an associated procedure and forward the relevant information
to the Near-RT RIC based on a pre-configured trigger event;

\- E2 interface supports the ability to send control messages (e.g. UE
basis, Cell basis) to the E2 Node;

\- E2 interface supports the ability to provide the E2 Node with a set
of policies to use when defined events occur;

\- E2 interface supports the ability for E2 Node to inform the Near-RT
RIC of what functionality it supports;

\- E2 interface supports the ability to query the E2 Node for relevant
RAN- and/or UE-related information;

> \- E2 interface supports the ability for E2 node to consume services
> produced by the Near-RT RIC.

With respect to the E2 interface, the E2 Node consists of:

\- Logical E2 Agent used to terminate the E2 interface, support global
services and to forward/receive RIC service messages towards RAN
Functions.

\- One or more RAN Functions that support RIC services exposed by the E2
Node to the Near-RT RIC.

\- Other RAN functions that do not support RIC Services.

[]{#_Toc184217356 .anchor}Figure 5.1.2-1: Relationship between Near-RT
RIC and E2 Node

## 5.2 E2 interface specification objectives

The E2 interface specifications shall facilitate the following:

\- Connectivity between Near-RT RIC and E2 Node supplied by different
vendors;

\- Exposure of selected E2 Node data (e.g. configuration information
(cell configuration, supported slices, PLMNs, etc.), network
measurements, context information, etc.) towards the Near-RT RIC;

\- Enables the Near-RT RIC to control selected RAN functions on the E2
Node.

## 5.3 Functions of the E2 interface

### 5.3.1 General

The E2 functions are grouped into the following categories:

RIC services supported by RIC functional procedures:

\- RIC Services (**REPORT**, **INSERT**, **CONTROL**, **POLICY**,
**QUERY** and **ASSISTANCE**), as described in clause 5.3.2) supported
by RIC functional procedures (RIC Subscription, RIC Subscription
Modification, RIC Subscription Modification Required, RIC Subscription
Delete, RIC Subscription Delete Required, RIC Subscription Audit, RIC
Subscription State Control, RIC Indication, RIC Control, RIC Query, RIC
Service Load Status, RIC Service Load Update, RIC Assistance, RIC
Assistance Indication, RIC Assistance Halt).

Global procedures:

\- Interface Management procedures (E2 Setup, Reset, E2 Node
Configuration Update, E2 connection Update, E2 Removal, E2 Resource
Status, E2 Resource Status Update, Error Indication)

\- RAN Function procedures (RIC Service Update, RIC Service Query).

### 5.3.2 RIC services and related procedures

#### 5.3.2.1 RIC services

Near-RT RIC may use the following RIC services provided by an E2 node:

\- **REPORT**: Near-RT RIC uses a RIC Subscription and/or RIC
Subscription Modification procedures to request that E2 Node sends a
**REPORT** message to Near-RT RIC and the associated procedure continues
in the E2 Node after each occurrence of a defined RIC Subscription
procedure Event Trigger.

\- **INSERT**: Near-RT RIC uses a RIC Subscription and/or RIC
Subscription Modification procedures to request that E2 Node sends an
**INSERT** message to Near-RT RIC after each occurrence of a defined RIC
Subscription procedure Event Trigger.

\- **CONTROL**: Near-RT RIC sends a **CONTROL** message to E2 Node to
initiate a new associated procedure or resume an associated procedure in
the E2 Node.

\- **POLICY:** Near-RT RIC uses a RIC Subscription and/or RIC
Subscription Modification procedures to request that E2 Node executes a
specific **POLICY** during functioning of the E2 Node after each
occurrence of a defined RIC Subscription procedure Event Trigger.

\- **QUERY**: Near-RT RIC sends a **QUERY** message to the E2 node to

#### 5.3.2.3 INSERT service

The **INSERT** service involves following steps:

1\) Near-RT RIC configures, and subsequently may modify, a RIC
Subscription in the E2 Node with information for an INSERT action, along
with an associated Subsequent Action Information (Subsequent Action
type, Time to Wait timer), that is to be performed by E2 Node with each
occurrence of Event.

2\) During normal functioning of an associated procedure in the E2 Node,
a trigger event is detected.

3\) After completing any previous RIC actions, E2 Node waits for the
corresponding response for up to a defined Time to Wait period.

4\) E2 Node sends RIC INDICATION message to Near-RT RIC containing the
requested **INSERT** information along with the originating Request ID
and information to identify the associated procedure.

5\) According to the Time to Wait timer state, arrival of RIC CONTROL
procedure, and Subsequent Action parameter in the RIC Subscription, the
E2 Node may then:

a\) RIC CONTROL REQUEST message arrives in time:\
This case is described in clause 5.3.2.4.

b\) The associated Time to Wait timer expires and Subsequent Action Type
set to Continue:\
Continue the original associated procedure, including any subsequent RIC
actions, if and when the associated Time to Wait timer expires. If the
Near-RT RIC subsequently sends a RIC CONTROL REQUEST message with the
Call Process ID for the same associated procedure, then the E2 Node
shall respond with the RIC CONTROL FAILURE message with a cause to
indicate that the timer has expired. See also clause 5.3.2.4.

c\) The associated Time to Wait timer expires and Subsequent Action Type
set to Halt:\
Halt the original associated procedure, including any subsequent RIC
actions, if and when the associated Time to Wait timer expires. If the
Near-RT RIC subsequently sends a RIC CONTROL REQUEST message with the
Call Process ID for the same associated procedure, then the E2 Node
shall respond with the RIC CONTROL FAILURE message with a cause to
indicate that the timer has expired. See also clause 5.3.2.4.

#### 5.3.2.4 CONTROL service

The **CONTROL** service involves following steps:

Near-RT RIC detects an event trigger. This step may be triggered by
either:

a\) a previous RIC INDICATION message sent by E2 Node;

b\) internal to Near-RT RIC.

1\) Near-RT RIC performs an action.

2\) Near-RT RIC sends a RIC CONTROL REQUEST message to E2 Node. This
message may contain information to identify the associated procedure,
and may request acknowledgement from the E2 Node. The Near-RT RIC shall
set the timer T~RICcontrol~ if either acknowledgement has been requested
or the optional acknowledgement request was not present in the RIC
CONTROL REQUEST message.

3\) The E2 Node cancels the associated Time to Wait timer if previously
set, and initiates or resumes the associated procedure.

4\) E2 Node then:

i\) If the requested control service is successfully executed, and if
acknowledgement was requested or if the optional RIC Control Ack Request
was not present, the E2 Node sends the RIC CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGE message
with the optional RIC Control Outcome providing information about the
result of the request Control service.

ii\) If the requested control service fails to execute or the request is
not accepted, the E2 Node sends the RIC CONTROL FAILURE message with a
cause indicating the reason for failure or rejection and the optional
RIC Control outcome providing information about the reason for failure
to execute.

5\) If previously set, the Near-RT RIC shall cancel the T~RICcontrol~
timer

The RIC Subscription, RIC Subscription Modification, RIC Subscription
Modification Required, RIC Subscription Delete, and RIC Subscription
Delete Required procedures are used to establish, modify or delete RIC
subscriptions on the E2 Node. The RIC Subscription State Control
procedure is used to suspend and/or resume one or more RIC
Subscriptions. The RIC Subscription Audit procedure is used to audit the
list of established RIC Subscriptions.

The RIC Subscription, RIC Subscription Modification, RIC Subscription
Delete, RIC Subscription Audit and RIC Subscription State Control
procedures are initiated by the Near-RT RIC (Figure 5.3.2.6-1). In
addition, the E2 Node may initiate a RIC Subscription Delete Required
procedure to request removal of one or more existing RIC Subscriptions
(Figure 5.3.2.6-2) and a RIC Subscription Modification Required
procedure to request the modification or removal of one or more existing
RIC services within an existing RIC Subscription (Figure 5.3.2.6-3).

RIC Service Load Update procedure is used by the E2 Node to report the
RIC Service load information related to one or more RIC Services. These
reports shall be sent by the E2 Node if requested by the Near-RT RIC
using the RIC Service Load Status procedure (Figure 5.3.2.6-4).

### 5.3.3 Combining RIC services within a common RIC Subscription

RIC services defined in clause 5.3.2 may be combined within a common
Subscription with each RIC Service implemented as part of a sequence of
Actions.

Where appropriate in these cases, successive **REPORT** or **INSERT**
messages sent to Near-RT RIC under the same subscription event trigger
would contain the same assigned Subscription Request identifier, the
same optional sequence number and each message with the unique assigned
Action identifier.

Examples include:

**- POLICY** then **REPORT**. In this case, at each occurrence of the
defined Event Trigger, the E2 Node would be instructed to first execute
a defined POLICY and then send a defined REPORT message

**- REPORT** then **REPORT**. In this case, at each occurrence of the
defined Event Trigger, the E2 Node would be instructed to first send a
defined REPORT message to be followed by a second defined REPORT message
containing normally different information.

When more than one RIC service action has been accepted by the E2 Node
then actions shall be executed as specified in O-RAN WG3.TS.E2AP \[2\].

### 5.3.4 Combining RIC services as a sequence of RIC services

RIC services defined in clause 5.3.2 may be combined using a sequence of
different RIC services implemented using a procedure executed within the
Near-RT RIC.

Examples include:

**- REPORT** followed by **POLICY.** In this case, at each occurrence of
the defined Event Trigger, the E2 Node would be instructed to send a
defined **REPORT** message. The Near-RT RIC would use the information
from one or more successive **REPORT** messages as input to a procedure
that may result in a change or establishment of a RIC **POLICY**
service.

**- INSERT** followed by **CONTROL.** In this case, at each occurrence
of the defined Event Trigger, the E2 Node would be instructed to send a
defined **INSERT** message containing information used to identify the
associated procedure and then the Near-RT RIC would send a corresponding
**CONTROL** message containing information used to identify a previous
suspended associated procedure.

**- REPORT** followed by **CONTROL.** In this case, at each occurrence
of the defined Event Trigger, the E2 Node would be instructed to send a
defined **REPORT** message. The Near-RT RIC would use the information
from one or more successive REPORT messages as input to a procedure that
may result in a RIC **CONTROL** service message being sent to initiate
an associated procedure in the E2 Node.

## 5.4 RAN Function E2 Service Model

As described in clause 5.1 the E2 interface is used to carry messages
between a given E2 Node and Near-RT RIC. These messages may contain RAN
Function specific content which is described in the corresponding RAN
Function specific E2 Service Model.

Each RAN Function is described in the following terms:

\- *RAN Function Definition*. Defines the RAN Function Name and
describes the RIC Services that the specific RAN Function is currently
configured to present over the E2 interface.

\- *RIC Event Trigger Definition* approach. Describes the approach to be
used in RIC Subscription and RIC Subscription Modification procedures to
set or modify the RIC Event Trigger Definition in the RAN Function for
RIC Services **REPORT**, **INSERT** and/or **POLICY**.

\- *RIC Action Definition* approach. Describes the approach to be used
in RIC Subscription and RIC Subscription Modification procedures to set
or modify the required sequence of RIC Action in the RAN Function for
RIC Services **REPORT**, **INSERT** and/or **POLICY**.

\- *RIC Indication Header* and *RIC Indication Message* approach.
Describes the approach to be used in RIC Indication procedure for RIC
Services **REPORT** and **INSERT**.

\- *RIC Control Header* and *RIC Control Message* approach. Describes
the approach to be used in RIC Control procedure for RIC Service
**CONTROL**.

\- *RIC Call Process ID* approach. Describes the approach to be used by
the E2 node in RIC Indication procedure for RIC Service **INSERT**. The
same IE is used in the subsequent RIC Control procedure for RIC Service
**CONTROL**.

\- *RIC Control Outcome* approach. Describes the approach to be used by
the E2 node in RIC Control procedure for RIC service **CONTROL**.

\- RAN Function Policies. Describes the set of policies that the RAN
Function is configured to support and the corresponding Parameters that
may be used to configure the policy using RIC Service **POLICY**.

\- *RIC Query Header* and *RIC Query Definition* approach. Describes the
approach to be used by the Near-RT RIC in RIC Query procedure for RIC
Service **QUERY**.

\- *RIC Query Outcome* approach. Describes the approach to be used by
the E2 node in RIC Query procedure for RIC Service **QUERY**.

\- *RIC Assistance Header* and *RIC Assistance Message* approach.
Describes the approach to be used in RIC Assistance procedure for RIC
Service **ASSISTANCE**.

\- *RIC Assistance Outcome* approach. Describes the approach to be used
by the Near-RT RIC in RIC Assistance procedure for RIC Service
**ASSISTANCE**.

\- *Service Level Cause* approach. Describes the approach to be used
across all RIC Functional procedures for reporting service level faults.

## 5.5 Global procedures

### 5.5.1 General

The E2 interface supports the following global procedures:

\- E2 Setup

\- Reset

\- Error Indication

\- RIC Service Update

\- RIC Service Query

\- E2 Node Configuration Update

\- E2 Connection Update

\- E2 Removal

\- E2 Resource Status

\- E2 Resource Status Update

The E2 Setup, Reset, RIC Service Update, RIC Service Query, E2 Node
Configuration Update, E2 Removal, E2 Resource Status and E2 Resource
Status Procedure procedures are described in further details in the
following clauses. E2 Connection Update is described in clause 6.2.

### 5.5.2 E2 Setup procedure

The E2 Setup procedure is used to establish the E2 interface between the
Near-RT RIC and an E2 Node. During this procedure the E2 Node provides:

\- List of supported RIC services and mapping of services to functions
within the E2 Node. This information is specific to each RAN Function in
the E2 node and is defined by a specific E2 Service Model as described
in clause 5.4

\- List of E2 Node configuration information. The configuration
information is specific to the E2 Node type (see clause 4.2) and based
on the re-use of 3GPP RAN3 defined configuration update messages.

If the E2 Setup procedure fails, the Near-RT RIC may provide an
alternative Transport Layer Information for the E2 Node to use when
reinitiating the E2 Setup procedure.

If a RAN Function received from the E2 Node contains one or more RIC
assistance services, and some of them cannot be supported by the Near-RT
RIC, the Near-RT RIC may respond to the E2 Node with a revised RAN
Function that excludes the unsupported RIC assistance services while
retaining the rest.

### 5.5.3 Reset procedure

The Reset procedure is used by either the E2 Node or Near-RT RIC to
reset the E2 interface.

Information previous exchanged during E2 Setup, E2 Node Configuration
Update and RIC Service Update procedures shall be maintained however the
outcome of all previous RIC Subscription shall be deleted from the E2
Node and E2 Node gracefully terminates any ongoing RIC Services.

The Near-RT RIC may then proceed to re-establish any RIC Subscriptions
as required.

### 5.5.4 RIC Service Update procedure

The RIC Service Update procedure is used by the E2 Node to inform the
Near-RT RIC of any change to the list of supported RIC services and
mapping of services to functions within the E2 Node. This information is
specific to each RAN Function in the E2 node and is defined by a
specific E2 Service Model as described in clause 5.4.

If a RAN Function received from the E2 Node contains one or more RIC
assistance services, and some of them cannot be supported by the Near-RT
RIC, the Near-RT RIC may respond to the E2 Node with a revised RAN
Function that excludes the unsupported RIC assistance services while
retaining the rest.

### 5.5.4A RIC Service Query procedure

The RIC Service Query procedure is used by the Near-RT RIC to query the
E2 Node with respect to the current list of supported RIC Services. The
query procedure may be used to either request a complete list of
supported RIC services or to request that the E2 Node compares the list
of RIC Services provided in the query message with its current list of
supported RIC Services.

This procedure is initiated by the Near-RT RIC sending a RIC SERVICE
QUERY message.

The E2 Node Configuration Update procedure is used by the E2 Node to
inform the Near-RT RIC of any change to the configuration of the E2 Node
and/or E2 Node initiated changes to TNL Associations associated with the
E2 interface. The configuration information is specific to the E2 Node
type (see clause 4.2) and based on the re-use of 3GPP RAN3 defined
configuration update messages.

See clause 6.2 for further details on E2 Node Configuration Update
procedure usage for E2 Node initiated changes to TNL Associations
associated with the E2 interface.

### 5.5.6 E2 Removal procedure

The E2 Removal procedure is used by either the E2 Node or Near-RT RIC to
release the E2 signalling connection.

If the procedure is E2 node initiated, after the E2 REMOVAL RESPONSE is
received, the E2 node initiates termination of all TNL associations
associated with this E2 interface. The Near-RT RIC and E2 nodes releases
all resources associated with this E2 interface. If the E2 Removal
procedure fails, the E2 node may retry the E2 Removal procedure.

If the procedure is Near-RT RIC initiated, after the E2 REMOVAL RESPONSE
is received, the Near-RT RIC initiates termination of all TNL
associations associated with this E2 interface. The Near-RT RIC and E2
nodes releases all resources associated with this E2 interface. If the
E2 Removal procedure fails, the Near-RT RIC may retry the E2 Removal
procedure.

### 5.5.7 E2 Resource Status

This procedure is used by a Near-RT RIC to request the reporting of load
measurements to E2 node. During this procedure, the E2 Node provides the
E2 node level resource status and traffic load information over the E2
interface.

If the E2 Resource Status initiation fails, the Near-RT RIC may retry
the E2 Resource Status initiation procedure.

### 5.5.8 E2 Resource Status Update

The E2 Resource Status Update is used by the E2 Node to inform the
Near-RT RIC of the results of the resource measurements that were
successfully initiated during the preceding E2 Resource Status procedure
(see clause 5.5.7). After the E2 Resource Status Update is received
containing information describing the available resources in the E2
Node, the Near-RT RIC may suspend the initiation of new RIC procedures
or may initiate RIC Subscription Delete procedures to reduce E2 Node
load.

# 6 E2 interface signalling

## 6.1 E2 control plane protocol (E2AP)

The control plane protocol stack of the E2AP interface is shown on
Figure 6.1-1.

The transport network layer is built on IP transport. For the reliable
transport of signalling messages, IETF RFC 4960 \[12\] is added on top
of IP.

When configurations with multiple SCTP associations are supported, the
Near-RT RIC may request to dynamically add/remove SCTP associations
between the E2 Node/Near-RT RIC pair. Within the set of SCTP
associations established between one Near-RT RIC and E2 node pair, the
Near-RT RIC may request the E2 Node to restrict the usage of SCTP
association for certain types of E2 signalling. If no restriction
information is provided for an SCTP association, any type of E2
signalling is allowed via the SCTP association.

The application layer signalling protocol is referred to as E2AP (E2
Application Protocol). The Payload Protocol Identifier assigned by IANA
to be used by SCTP for the application layer protocol E2AP is 70. This
value is to be used for all deployment configurations described in the
present document. Payload Protocol Identifiers 71 and 72, also assigned
by IANA for E2, are reserved for future use.

No SCTP Destination Port number value was assigned by IANA for the E2AP
protocol and so networks shall rely on E2 node and Near-RT RIC
configuration to select a suitable port number.

NOTE 1: E2AP messages are transported over the E2 interfaces.

## 6.2 Multiple TNLAs over E2 

The Near-RT RIC and E2 Node supports multiple TNL associations over E2
interface.

An initial TNL association is established during E2 Setup procedure with
E2 Node initiating SCTP connection. At this point the single TNL
association is configured to be used for both RIC Services (clause 5.3)
and E2 Support functions (clause 5.5).

TNL associations may then be added, modified or removed during
subsequent E2 Connection Update and E2 Node Configuration Update
procedures with E2 Node initiating SCTP connections where required.

When the Near-RT RIC requests to dynamically add additional SCTP
associations between the Near-RT RIC/E2 Node pair, the Near-RT RIC sends
additional SCTP endpoints using the E2 Connection Update procedure. The
E2 Node shall establish the SCTP associations. The SCTP Destination Port
number value may be the same port number used for the initial E2 Setup
procedure, or any dynamic port value (IETF RFC 6335 \[23\]).

Within the set of SCTP associations established between one Near-RT RIC
and E2 node pair, a single SCTP association shall be employed for E2AP
elementary procedures utilized for E2 Support Function signalling (i.e.
defined in O-RAN WG3.TS.E2AP \[2\] clause 8.3) with the possibility of
fail-over to a new association to enable robustness.

When the configuration with multiple SCTP endpoints per E2 node is
supported and E2 node wants to add an additional SCTP association, the
E2 Node Configuration Update procedure shall be the first E2AP procedure
triggered on an additional TNLA of an already setup E2 interface after
the TNL association has become operational. The E2 Node uses a SCTP
endpoint of the Near-RT RIC already in use for existing TNL associations
between the Near-RT RIC/E2 Node pair when establishing the additional
SCTP association, and the Near-RT RIC shall associate the TNLA to the E2
interface using the included Global E2 Node ID. The E2 Node uses the E2
Node Configuration Update procedure when it wants to remove additional
SCTP association.

The RIC Subscription TNLA binding is a binding between a specific TNL
association and RIC Service signalling (i.e. defined in O-RAN
WG3.TS.E2AP \[2\] clause 8.2) of a specific RIC Subscription. After the
RIC Subscription TNLA binding is created, the Near-RT RIC can update the
RIC Subscription TNLA binding by sending the E2AP message for the RIC
Subscription to the E2 Node via a different TNLA. The E2 Node shall
update the RIC Subscription TNLA binding with the new TNLA. The E2
Configuration Update procedure also allows the E2 Node to inform the
Near-RT RIC that the indicated TNLA(s) will be removed by the E2 Node.

Between one Near-RT RIC and E2 Node pair:

\- A single pair of stream identifiers shall be reserved over an SCTP
association for the sole use of E2AP elementary procedures utilized for
E2 Support Function signalling (i.e. defined in O-RAN WG3.TS.E2AP \[2\]
clause 8.3).

\- At least one pair of stream identifiers over one or several SCTP
associations shall be reserved for the sole use of E2AP elementary
procedures utilized for RIC Service signalling (i.e. defined in O-RAN
WG3.TS.E2AP \[2\] clause 8.2). However, a few pairs (i.e. more than one)
should be reserved.

\- For any RIC service signalling (i.e. defined in O-RAN WG3.TS.E2AP
\[2\] clause 8.2) of a single RIC Subscription, the E2 Node shall use
one SCTP association and one SCTP stream, and the SCTP
association/stream should not be changed until after the current SCTP
association is failed, or the RIC Subscription TNLA binding update is
performed.

Transport network redundancy may be achieved by SCTP multi-homing
between two end-points, of which one or both is assigned with multiple
IP addresses. SCTP end-points shall support a multi-homed remote SCTP
end-point. For SCTP endpoint redundancy an INIT may be sent from a
Near-RT RIC or E2 Node, at any time for an already established SCTP
association, which shall be handled as defined in IETF RFC 4960 \[12\]
in sub clause 5.2.

The SCTP congestion control may, using an implementation specific
mechanism, initiate higher layer protocols to reduce the signalling
traffic at the source and prioritize certain messages.

# 7 Security for the E2 interface

## 7.1 General

The security requirements given in this clause only apply to the E2
interface.

## 7.2 Requirements for the E2 interfaces

The requirements given below apply to E2 interface defined in the
present document:

\- E2 interface shall support confidentiality, integrity, replay
protection and data origin authentication.

## 7.3 Security mechanism for the E2 interface

In order to protect the traffic on the E2 interface, IPsec ESP
implementation shall be supported according to IETF RFC 4303 \[20\] as
profiled by 3GPP TS 33.210 \[21\]. For IPsec implementation, tunnel mode
is mandatory to support while transport mode is optional. The multiple
IKE Security Associations (SAs), multiple IPsec SAs and multiple IPsec
SAs per IPsec tunnel (e.g. for rekeying) shall be supported.

IKEv2 certificate-based authentication implementation shall be supported
according to 3GPP TS 33.310 \[22\]. The certificates shall be supported
according to the profile described by 3GPP TS 33.310 \[22\]. IKEv2 shall
be supported conforming to the IKEv2 profile described in 3GPP TS 33.310
\[22\].

# 8 Other E2 interface specifications

## 8.1 O-RAN E2 interface: E2 Application Protocol (E2AP) (ORAN-WG3.E2AP)

The technical specification ORAN WG3.E2AP \[2\] specifies the signalling
protocol between the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node over the E2 interface.

## 8.2 O-RAN E2 interface: E2 Service Model (E2SM) specifications

The technical specification ORAN WG3.E2SM \[17\] provides the list of
the supported RAN Function-specific E2 Service Models supported over the
E2 interface and presents a recommended layout for additional E2SM
specifications.

# Annex A (normative): Deployment considerations

## A.1 Deployment use cases

The Near-RT RIC may be connected to range of different E2 Node
configurations as described in the list implementation options in Annex
A.4 of O-RAN WG1.TS.OAD \[18\]. Examples include:

\- Standalone O-CU-CP connected to one or more standalone O-CU-UP and
one or more standalone O-DU. Each logical node is considered as an E2
Node that presents an E2 interface to the Near-RT RIC.

\- Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP connected to one or more standalone
O-DU. The combined O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP may present either a common E2
interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual
O-RAN components

\- Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU. The combined node may present
either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding
to the individual O-RAN components

In all cases the different RAN components may initiate either
independent E2 connections to the Near-RT RIC for each logical O-RAN
component or may present a shared E2 interface and hence present the
combined RAN components as a common E2 Node supporting services
appropriate to more than one logical O-RAN component.

In all cases each E2 Node shall present a single E2 interface to the
Near-RT RIC and shall announce which E2 Services supports for each
logical O-RAN component.

Example deployment use case are presented in Figures A.1-1 and A.1-2.
