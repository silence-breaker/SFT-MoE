# 3 Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations

## 3.1 Terms

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[i.1\] apply.

In addition, the terms defined in O-RAN WG3.TS.E2GAP \[2\], O-RAN
WG1.TS.OAD \[27\], and the following also apply:

NOTE: A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the
definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[i.1\], O-RAN
WG3.TS.E2GAP \[2\], and O-RAN WG1.TS.OAD \[27\].

**E2 Node Component ID**: local identifier used to uniquely identify an
E2 Node component

**Elementary Procedure:** E2AP protocol consists of Elementary
Procedures (EPs)

NOTE: An E2AP Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between the
Near-RT RIC and an E2 Node. An EP consists of an initiating message and
possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:

Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success or failure),

Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.

**Global E2 Node ID**: global identifier of an E2 Node. Defined as the
global eNB or gNB identifier and an optional local identifier of an
CU-UP or DU which is required when and if an individual DU or CU-UP
supports a direct E2 interface

**Global RIC ID**: global identifier of a Near-RT RIC

**RAN Function ID**: local identifier of a specific RAN Function within
an E2 Node that supports one or more RIC Services using a specific E2
Service Model

**RAN Function OID**: RAN Function Object Identifier used to identify
specific RAN function definition (i.e. E2SM used by specific RAN
Function)

**RIC Action ID**: local identifier used Near-RT RIC to identify a
specific RIC Service Action within a specific RIC Subscription Request,
used by E2 Node in subsequent RIC Indication messages

**RIC Call Process ID**: local identifier used by E2 Node to identify
the associated procedure during an Insert RIC Service Action, used by
Near-RT RIC in subsequent RIC Control procedure

**RIC Request ID**: local identifier used to identify a specific RIC
Functional procedure among all ongoing parallel procedures of the same
type initiated by the same protocol peer.

NOTE: Messages belonging to the same procedure use the same RIC Request
ID. The RIC Request ID is determined by the initiating peer of a RIC
Functional Procedure.

**Transaction ID**: local identifier used to uniquely identify a Global
Procedure among all ongoing parallel procedures of the same type
initiated by the same protocol peer

NOTE: Messages belonging to the same procedure use the same Transaction
ID. The Transaction ID is determined by the initiating peer of a Global
Procedure (Near-RT RIC or E2 Node).

## 3.2 Symbols

Void.

## 3.3 Abbreviations

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[i.1\] apply.

In addition, the abbreviations defined in O-RAN WG1.TS.OAD \[18\] and
the following also apply:

NOTE: An abbreviation defined in the present document takes precedence
over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP
TR 21.905 \[i.1\] and O-RAN WG1.TS.OAD \[27\].

# 4 General

## 4.1 Procedure specification principles

The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the
functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any
rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be
possible to be verified with information that is visible within the
system.

The following specification principles have been applied for the
procedure text in clause 8:

\- The procedure text discriminates between:

1\) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed.

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the
REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with
the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure,
containing an appropriate cause value.

2\) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed.

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if
supported,\" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If
the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support
functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of
the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the nonsupported
functionality.

\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does
not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a
response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For
requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see clause 10.

## 4.2 Forwards and backwards compatibility

The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of
related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a
standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can
always be decoded regardless of the standard version.

[]{#_Toc184217657 .anchor}Figure 8.2.1.2-1: RIC Subscription procedure,
successful operation

The Near-RT RIC initiates the procedure by sending a RIC SUBSCRIPTION
REQUEST message, which shall contain a unique *RIC Request ID* IE,
assigned by the Near-RT RIC, to the E2 Node.

When the Near-RT RIC sends the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message, it
shall start the timer T~RICEVENTcreate.~

At reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message the E2 Node shall:

\- Determine the target RAN Function using the information in the *RAN
Function ID* IE and configure the requested event trigger using
information in the *RIC Subscription Details* IE.

\- If one or more Report, Insert and/or Policy RIC Service Actions are
included in the *RIC Subscription Details* IE then the target RAN
Function shall validate the event trigger and requested action sequence
and, if accepted, store the required *RIC Request ID, RIC Event Trigger
Definition* IE and sequence of RIC Service Actions.

\- If optional *RIC Subscription Start Time* IE is present and has
expired, then the E2 Node shall ignore the optional *RIC Subscription
Start Time* IE.

If the requested trigger and at least one required RIC Service Action
are accepted by the E2 Node, the E2 Node shall reserve for each admitted
RIC Service Action the necessary resources and send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION
RESPONSE message back to the Near-RT RIC.

The E2 Node shall include in the response message the RIC Service
Actions for which resources have been prepared at the E2 Node in the
*RIC Actions Admitted List* IE.

The E2 Node shall include the RIC Service Actions that have not been
admitted in the *RIC Actions Not Admitted List* IE with an appropriate
cause value.

Upon reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE message the Near-RT RIC
shall stop timer T~RICEVENTcreate~ and terminate the RIC Subscription
procedure.

If more than one RIC Service Actions has been accepted by the E2 Node
then, at each occurrence of the common Event Trigger, the sequence of
RIC Service Actions shall be executed according to the following
considerations:

\- If optional *RIC Action Execution Order* IE is not present or is
present and set to 0 (\"Any order\"), then the specific RIC Service
Action in the sequence of RIC Service Actions may be executed in any
order irrespective of the execution order of the other RIC Service
Actions.

\- If optional *RIC Action Execution Order* IE is present and set to a
value greater than 0, then the specific RIC Service Action shall be
executed in order according to the *RIC Action Execution Order* IE.

\- If two or more RIC Service Actions have the same value for the
optional *RIC Action Execution Order* IE then these RIC Service Actions
shall be executed in parallel.

If the optional *RIC Subscription Start Time* IE is present, the E2 Node
shall only enable the event trigger from the indicated start time.

If the optional *RIC Subscription End Time* IE is present, the E2 Node
shall disable the event trigger when the indicated end time has expired.

**Interactions with RIC Subscription Delete Required procedure:**

If the optional *RIC Subscription End Time* IE is present and the
indicated end time has expired, the E2 Node may send the RIC
SUBSCRIPTION DELETE REQUIRED message to the Near-RT RIC with an
appropriate cause value.

**Interactions with RIC Subscription Delete procedure:**

If the optional *RIC Subscription End Time* IE is present, the Near-RT
RIC may initiate an RIC Subscription Delete procedure when the expected
*RIC Subscription End Time* has expired.

If a failure occurs during the RIC Subscription procedure the E2 Node
shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC
containing an appropriate cause value.

If the E2 Node admits none of the requested RIC Service Actions, or
detects an issue with the requested sequence of RIC Service Actions, or
in the optional *RIC Subsequent Action* IE definitions, the E2 Node
shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC
containing an appropriate cause value.

If the RIC Subscription procedure contains an invalid optional *RIC
Subscription Start Time* IE and/or *RIC Subscription End Time* IE, the
E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT
RIC containing an appropriate cause value.

Upon reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message the Near-RT RIC
shall stop the timer T~RICEVENTcreate~ and terminate the RIC
Subscription procedure.

**Interactions with RIC Subscription Delete procedure:**

If there is no response from the E2 Node to the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST
message before timer T~RICEVENTcreate~ expires in the Near-RT RIC, the
Near-RT RIC shall initiate the RIC Subscription Delete procedure
containing *RIC Request ID* IE that was previously assigned by the
Near-RT RIC to cancel the RIC Subscription towards the E2 Node. The
Near-RT RIC shall ignore any RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE or RIC
SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message containing *RIC Request ID* IE that was
previously assigned by the Near-RT RIC received after the initiation of
the RIC Subscription Delete procedure and release any resources related
to the concerned E2 Node.

#### 8.2.1.4 Abnormal conditions

If the E2 Node receives a RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message containing
*RIC Subscription Details* IE that does not align with the specific E2
Service Model, see O-RAN WG3.TS.E2SM \[3\], the E2 Node shall send the
RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC containing an
appropriate cause value.

If the E2 Node receives a RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message which
contains an unknown *RAN Function ID* IE, the E2 Node shall send the RIC
SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC containing an
appropriate cause value.

If the E2 Node receives a RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message containing
identical contents the E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE
message to the Near-RT RIC containing an appropriate cause value.

Modification procedure, successful operation

The Near-RT RIC initiates this procedure by sending the RIC SUBSCRIPTION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the E2 node, containing the *RIC Request
ID* IE to uniquely identify the existing RIC Subscription in the E2
node.

When the Near-RT RIC sends the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST
message, it shall start timer T~RICEVENTmodify~.

Upon reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the
E2 node shall determine the existing RIC Subscription and the target RAN
Function from the *RIC Request ID* IE and the *RAN Function ID* IE,
respectively.

If the *RIC Event Trigger Definition to be Modified* IE is included,
then the E2 node shall validate and modify the event trigger defined for
the existing RIC subscription based on the contents of the IE.

If the *RIC Actions to be Removed List* IE is included, then for every
*RIC Action ID* IE included in the list, the E2 node shall delete the
requested action and release the corresponding necessary resources.

If the *RIC Actions to be Modified List* IE is included, then for every
*RIC Action ID* IE included in the list for which there exists a
corresponding *RIC Action Definition* IE and/or *RIC Subsequent Action*
IE, the E2 node shall modify the existing behaviour for the action with
the requested modification in the respective IEs and modify the
corresponding necessary resources*.*

If the *RIC Actions to be Modified List* IE is included, then for every
*RIC Action ID* IE included in the list for which there exists a *RIC
Action Execution Order* IE, the E2 node shall replace the current
execution order for the action in the sequence of actions with the new
execution order for the action in the sequence, as given in the *RIC
Action Execution Order* IE.

If the *RIC Actions to be Added List* IE is included, then the E2 node
shall validate and add the requested actions to the existing sequence of
RIC Actions in order of the *RIC Action Execution Order* IE and reserve
the necessary resources for the new actions.

The E2 node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION RESPONSE
message back to the Near-RT RIC when one of the following cases is
successfully executed:

\- If the *RIC Event Trigger Definition to be Modified* IE is present in
the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST message and if the requested
modification for the event trigger definition was successfully performed
by the E2 node, or

\- If the *RIC Event Trigger Definition to be Modified* IE is not
present (i.e., no modification to the event trigger definition was
requested) in the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST message and if
at least one of the requested actions to be added or modified or removed
as requested by the Near-RT RIC in *RIC Actions To Be Added List* IE or
*RIC Actions to be Modified List* IE or *RIC Actions to be Removed List*
IE, respectively, in the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST message,
was successfully performed by the E2 node.

The E2 node shall report the result of all the requested modifications
to the sequence of actions, if any, back to the Near-RT RIC in the RIC
SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION RESPONSE message as follows:

\- A list of actions requested to be removed, indexed by the *RIC Action
ID* IE, which are successfully removed by the E2 node, shall be included
in the *RIC Actions Removed List* IE.

\- A list of actions requested to be removed, indexed by the *RIC Action
ID* IE, which failed to get removed from the sequence by the E2 node,
shall be included in the *RIC Actions Failed to be Removed List* IE,
with appropriate cause values.

\- A list of actions requested to be modified, indexed by the *RIC
Action ID* IE, which are successfully modified by the E2 node, shall be
included in the *RIC Actions Modified List* IE.

\- A list of actions requested to be modified, indexed by the *RIC
Action ID* IE, which failed to get modified by the E2 node, shall be
included in the *RIC Actions Failed to be Modified List* IE with
appropriate cause values.

\- A list of actions requested to be added, indexed by the *RIC Action
ID* IE, which are successfully added by the E2 node, shall be included
in the *RIC Actions Added List* IE.

\- A list of actions requested to be added, indexed by the *RIC Action
ID* IE, which failed to get added to the sequence by the E2 node, shall
be included in the *RIC Actions Failed to be Added List* IE with
appropriate cause values.

If, for a given *RIC Action ID* IE in the *RIC Actions to be Modified
List* IE, more than one modification to the RIC Service Action is
requested in the form of *RIC Action Definition* IE and/or *RIC Action
Execution Order* IE and/or *RIC Subsequent Action* IE, then the E2 node
shall report that the requested action modification is successfully
performed and shall include the action in the *RIC Actions Modified
List* IE, if and only if, all the requested modifications to the action
are successfully performed by the E2 node.

If one of the requested modifications to the RIC Service Action is not
successfully performed by the E2 node, then the E2 node shall include
the RIC Service Action in the *RIC Actions Failed to be Modified List*
IE, along with an appropriate cause, to indicate failure for the
requested modification to the RIC Service Action.

If, for a given *RIC Action ID* IE in the *RIC Actions to be Added* IE,
either the action type in the *RIC Action Type* IE or the action
definition in the *RIC Action Definition* IE or the action execution
order in the *RIC Action Execution Order* IE or the subsequent action,
if included, in the *RIC Subsequent Action* IE is not successfully
processed by the E2 node, then the E2 node shall include the action in
the *RIC Actions Failed to be Added List* IE with an appropriate cause,
indicating failure to add the requested action to the existing sequence
of actions.

If, after processing the RIC Subscription Modification procedure, more
than one RIC Service Action remains accepted by the E2 Node then, at
each occurrence of the common Event Trigger, the sequence of RIC Service
Actions shall be executed according to the considerations defined in
clause 8.2.1.2.

Upon reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION RESPONSE message,
the Near-RT RIC shall stop timer T~RICEVENTmodify~ and terminate the RIC
Subscription Modification procedure.

The Near-RT RIC initiates the procedure by sending a RIC LOAD STATUS
REQUEST message to the E2 Node.

Upon reception of the RIC SERVICE LOAD STATUS REQUEST message the E2
Node shall process the message according to the following
considerations:

The E2 Node:

\- Shall initiate the requested load information reporting according to
the parameters given in the request in case the *Registration Request*
IE set to \"start\"; or

\- Shall stop all measurements and terminate the reporting in case the
*Registration Request* IE is set to \"stop\"; or

\- Shall add load measurements indicated in the request to the
measurements initiated before for the given measurement IDs, in case the
*Registration Request* IE is set to \"add\". If measurements are already
initiated for a requested load measurement, this information shall be
ignored.

For each RAN Function in the *RAN Function Load Request List* IE:

\- If the *RAN Function Load Request* IE is present, the E2 Node shall
collect overall load information for the RAN Function identified by the
corresponding *RAN Function ID* IE.

\- If the *RIC Service Load Request* IE is present in the RIC SERVICE
LOAD STATUS REQUEST message, the E2 Node shall shall collect load
information for requested RIC Services.

\- If the *RIC Subscription Load Request List* IE is present and the
*RIC Subscription Load Request* IE is also included, the E2 Node shall
collect load information for the RIC Subscription identified by the *RIC
Request ID* IE. If the *RIC Action Load Request List* IE is also present
for a given RIC Subscription, the E2 Node shall collect load information
only for each RIC Action identified by the corresponding *RIC Action ID*
IE in the list. If the *RIC Action Load Request List* IE is not present
for a given RIC Subscription, the E2 Node shall collect load information
for all the RIC Actions associated with the RIC Subscription

After processing the RIC SERVICE LOAD STATUS REQUEST message, if the E2
Node has accepted at least one item in the *RAN Function Load Request
List* IE and/or *RIC Service Load Request List* IE and/or at least one
item in the *RIC Subscription Load Request List* IE, the E2 Node shall
send the RIC SERVICE LOAD STATUS RESPONSE message to the Near-RT RIC,
and initiate load reporting using the RIC Service Load Update procedure.

Upon reception of a RIC SERVICE UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall update
the application level data for E2 Node as follows:

\- If the *RAN Function Added List* IE is contained in the RIC SERVICE
UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall add each listed accepted RAN Function
according to the information in the *RAN Function ID* IE and *RAN
Function Definition* IE and store the corresponding *RAN Function

supported RAN Functions according to the information in the *RAN
Function Definition* IE and update the corresponding *RAN Function
Revision* IE.

\- If the *RAN Function Deleted List* IE is contained in the RIC SERVICE
UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall delete information of RAN Function
indicated by the *RAN Function ID* IE along with the corresponding *RAN
Function Revision* IE.

These changes may be processed in the Near-RT-RIC and may be used when
issuing RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST and RIC CONTROL to provide valid *RAN
Function ID* IE.

If at least one RAN Function update request present in the RIC SERVICE
UPDATE message is successful, then the Near-RT RIC shall send the RIC
SERVICE UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the initiating E2 Node with:

\- *RAN Functions Accepted List* IE indicating accepted requests to add,
modify, and/or delete the corresponding RAN Function information.

\- If required, the *RAN Functions Rejected List* IE indicating rejected

UPDATE message to the E2 Node. The message shall include an appropriate
set of up-to-date E2 interface connection data that the E2 Node shall
take into account when modifying the E2 interface connection.

Upon reception of a E2 CONNECTION UPDATE message, the E2 Node shall
update as follows:

\- If *E2 Connection To Add List* IE is contained in the E2 CONNECTION
UPDATE message, then the E2 Node shall, if supported, use the
information to establish additional TNL Association(s) and configure for
use for RIC services and/or E2 support functions according to the *TNL
Association Usage* IE in the message.

\- If *E2 Connection To Modify List* IE is contained in the E2
CONNECTION UPDATE message, then the E2 Node shall, if supported, use the
information to modify the existing usage for RIC services and/or E2
support functions, according to the *TNL Association Usage* IE in the
message.

\- If *E2 Connection To Remove List* IE is contained in the E2
CONNECTION UPDATE message, then the E2 Node shall, if supported, use the
information to remove the existing connection(s). If only one connection
remains after successful removal of other connections, the E2 Node shall
use this remaining connection for all the RIC services and E2 support
functions.

After successful update of E2 interface connection(s), the E2 Node shall
reply with the E2 CONNECTION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to inform the
initiating Near-RT RIC that the requested E2 connection update was
performed successfully.

If the E2 Node receives a E2 CONNECTION UPDATE message without any IE
except for *Message Typ*e IE and *Transaction ID* IE, the E2 Node shall
reply with the E2 CONNECTION ACKNOWLEDGE message without performing any
updates to the existing connections.

E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE procedure shall be the first E2AP procedure
triggered on an additional TNLA of an already setup E2 interface
instance after the TNL association has become operational, and the
Near-RT RIC shall associate the TNLA to the E2 interface instance using
the included *Global E2 Node ID*.

An empty E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message (i.e. without any IE
expect for *Message Type* IE and *Transaction ID* IE) shall be sent by
the Near-RT RIC as the first E2AP procedure on the new TNLA, if the E2

## 9.2 Information Element definitions

### 9.2.0 General

When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit
strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics
description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle
applies with regards to the ordering of bits:

\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the Most Significant Bit (MSB);

\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the Least Significant Bit
(LSB);

\- When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit
of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.

### 9.2.1 Cause

The purpose of the *Cause* IE is to indicate the reason for a particular
event for the E2AP protocol.

## 9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)

### 9.3.1 General

E2AP ASN.1 definition conforms to Recommendation ITU-T X.691 \[15\],
Recommendation ITU-T X.680 \[16\] and Recommendation ITU-T X.681 \[17\].

Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the E2AP protocol with
ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in
this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the
ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for
the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall
take precedence.

The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of E2AP
messages. E2AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set
definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrences
being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a
sending entity shall construct an E2AP message according to the PDU
definitions module and with the following additional rules:

\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.

\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE
shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format
there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list
elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container
list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE
container list may contain only one kind of list elements.

NOTE: In the above \"IE\" means an IE in the object set with an explicit
ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the
different occurrences will have different IE IDs.

If an E2AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received,
this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall
be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.

### 9.3.2 Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use

The private message mechanism for non-standard use is not supported with
E2AP.
