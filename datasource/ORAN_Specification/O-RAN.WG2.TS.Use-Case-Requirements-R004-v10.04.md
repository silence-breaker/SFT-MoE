# 4 Use cases

## 4.1 Traffic steering

This use case provides the motivation, description, and requirements for
traffic steering use case, allowing operators to specify different
objectives for traffic management such as optimizing the network/UE
performance, or achieving balanced cell load.

### 4.1.1 Background and goal of the use case

5G systems will support many different combinations of access
technologies namely; LTE (licensed band), NR (licensed band), NR-U
(unlicensed band), Wi-Fi (unlicensed band). Several different
multi-access deployment scenarios are possible with 5GC to support wide
variety of applications and satisfy the spectrum requirements of
different service providers;

-   Carrier aggregation between licensed band NR (primary cell) and NR-U
    (secondary cell)

-   Dual connectivity between licensed band NR (primary cell) and NR-U
    (secondary cell)

-   Dual connectivity between licensed band LTE (primary cell) and NR-U
    (secondary cell)

The rapid traffic growth and multiple frequency bands utilized in a
commercial network make it challenging to steer the traffic in a
balanced distribution. Further in a multi-access system there is need to
switch the traffic across access technologies based on changes in radio
environment and application requirements and even split the traffic
across multiple access technologies to satisfy performance requirements.
The different types of traffic and frequency bands in a commercial
network make it challenging to handle the complex QoS aspects, bearer
selection (Master Cell Group (MCG) bearer, Secondary Cell Group (SCG)
bearer, split bearer), bearer type change for load balancing, achieving
low latency and best in class throughput in a multi-access scenario with
5GC networks (as specified in 3GPP TS 37.340 \[8\]). Typical controls
are limited to adjusting the cell reselection and handover parameters;
modifying load calculations and cell priorities; and are largely static
in nature when selecting the type of bearers and QoS attributes.

Further, the RRM (Radio Resource Management) features in the existing
cellular network are either cell-centric or UE-centric. Even in
different areas within a cell, there are variations in radio
environment, such as neighboring cell coverage, signal strength,
interference status, etc. However, base stations based on traditional
control strategies treat all UEs in a similar way and both cell- and
UE-centric algorithms do exist.

Such current solutions suffer from following limitations:

1\) It is hard to adapt the RRM control to diversified scenarios and
optimization objectives.

2\) The traffic management strategy is usually passive, rarely taking
advantage of capabilities to predict network and UE performance. The
strategy needs to consider aspects of steering, switching and splitting
traffic across different access technologies in a multi-access scenario.

3\) Non-optimal traffic management, with slow response time, due to
various factors such as inability to select the right set of UEs for
control action. This further results in non-optimal system and UE
performance, such as suboptimal spectrum utilization, reduced throughput
and increased handover failures.

Based on the above reasons, the main objective of this use case is to
allow operators to flexibly configure the desired optimization policies,
utilize the right performance criteria, and leverage machine learning to
enable intelligent and proactive traffic management.

### 4.1.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

1)  SMO (including Non-RT RIC):

    a.  Retrieve necessary performance, configuration, and other data
        for defining and updating policies to guide the behavior of
        traffic management function in Near-RT RIC. For example, the
        policy could relate to specifying different optimization
        objectives to guide the carrier/band preferences at per-UE or
        group of UE granularity.

    b.  Retrieve necessary performance, configuration, and other data
        for performing data statistical analysis that will provide
        enrichment information for Near-RT RIC to assist in the traffic
        steering function. For example, this could be an analysis method
        to construct radio fingerprint based on UE measurement report
        with RSRP/RSRQ/CQI information for serving and neighbouring
        cells.

    c.  Support communication of policies to Near-RT RIC.

    d.  Support communication of measurement configuration parameters to
        RAN nodes.

    e.  Support communication of enrichment information to Near-RT RIC,
        e.g., radio fingerprint information, etc.

2)  Near-RT RIC:

    a.  Support interpretation and enforcement of policies from Non-RT
        RIC.

    b.  Support using enrichment information to optimize control
        function, e.g., Near-RT RIC can use radio finger print to
        directly predict the inter-frequency cell measurement based on
        the intra-frequency cell measurement result to speed up the
        traffic steering with much reduced signaling overhead.

3)  E2 nodes:

    a.  Support data collection with required granularity to SMO over O1
        interface.

### 4.1.4 Required data

The measurement counters and KPIs (as defined by 3GPP and will be
extended for O-RAN use cases) should be appropriately aggregated by
cell, QoS type, slice, etc.

1)  Measurement reports with RSRP/RSRQ/CQI information for serving and
    neighboring cells. In multi-access scenarios this will also include
    intra-RAT and inter-RAT measurement reports, cell quality
    thresholds, CGI reports and measurement gaps on per-UE or
    per-frequency.

2)  UE connection and mobility/handover statistics with indication of
    successful and failed handovers, other metrics including threshold
    of number of UEs to trigger traffic management at O-DU, O-CU-CP,
    etc.

3)  Cell load statistics such as information in the form of number of
    active users or connections, number of scheduled active users per
    TTI, PRB utilization, and CCE utilization, bearer metrics such as
    number of bearers to trigger traffic management at O-DU, O-CU-CP,
    etc.

4)  Per user performance statistics such as PDCP throughput, RLC or MAC
    layer latency, DL throughput thresholds to trigger traffic
    management at O-DU, O-CU-CP, etc.

### 4.1.5 A1 usage example

An example scenario is here used to describe the use of A1 for traffic
management, implying the Non-RT RIC sending policies for allocation of
the control plane (RRC) and the user plane for different services,
identified by their 5QI.

In the scenario a UE with UEid=1, belonging to a subnet slice identified
by S-NSSAI=1, having a voice (5QI=1) and an MBB (5QI=9) connection
established, enters an area covered by four frequency bands. The Non-RT
RIC understands the requirements and characteristics of the services and
decides to let the voice and RRC connection reside on the low band (here
covered by a macro cell B becoming the PCell), while the MBB connection
should preferably use the higher band (here provided by a smaller cell C
and D becoming the SCells) and avoid the low band if possible. Cell A is
used for MBB if required for coverage reasons.

Policies are sent to any cell of concern, e.g., where the UE resides and
can move.

The desired use of the cells is shown in figure 4.1.5-1.

![](media/image4.png){width="6.64375in" height="2.7848108048993874in"}

Figure 4.1.5-1: Desired use of the cells

Two policies over A1 are needed to accomplish the desired behavior,
described in JSON format below. Note that as part of the scope, the
cell_id is optional, and if omitted it is up to the Near-RT RIC to
locate the UE and there enforce the policy.

{

    \"policy_id\": \"1\",

    \"scope\": {

      \"ue_id\": \"1\",

      \"slice_id\": \"1\",

      \"qos_id\": \"1\",

"cell_id": "X" // Policy for Cell X, where X is one of A, B, C or D

    },

    \"statement\": {

      \"cell_id_list\": \"B\",

      \"preference\": \"Shall\",

      \"primary\": true // Control plane on Cell B (becoming PCell)

    },

    \"statement\": {

      \"cell_id_list \": \"B\",

      \"preference\": \"Shall\",

      \"primary\": true // Voice on Cell B

    }

}

{

    \"policy_id\": \"2\",

    \"scope\": {

      \"ue_id\": \"1\",

      \"slice_id\": \"1\",

      \"qos_id\": \"9\",

"cell_id": "X" // Policy for Cell X, where X is one of A, B, C or D

    },

    \"statement\": {

      \"cell_id_list \": {\"B\", "A"},

      \"preference\": \"Avoid\",

      \"primary\": false // Avoid MBB on Cell A and Cell B

    },

    \"statement\": {

      \"cell_id_list\": {"C", "D"},

      \"preference\": \"Prefer\",

      \"primary\": false // Prefer MBB on Cell C and Cell D

    }

}

Besides the cell level preference policy, there are also carrier level
preference policy for the traffic steering use case. Taking the above
scenario as an example, the UE with UEid=1, belonging to a subnet slice
identified by S-NSSAI=1, having a voice (5QI=1) and an MBB (5QI=9)
connection established, enters the area covered by four cells identified
by cell A, cell B, cell C and cell D, respectively.

Assuming that cell A and cell B work on the same frequency carrier which
can be identified by Arfcn_1, cell C and cell D work on the same
frequency carrier which can be identified by Arfcn_2. Carrier Arfcn_1 is
in low frequency and have narrow bandwidth and adapt to voice (5QI=1)
connection. Carrier Arfcn_2 is in high frequency and have wide bandwidth
and adapt to MBB (5QI=9) connection, meanwhile, avoid connection to the
low frequency bands.

The following policies are needed to accomplish this as described in
JSON format below.

{

    \"policy_id\": \"1\",

    \"scope\": {

      \"ue_id\": \"1\",

      \"slice_id\": \"1\",

      \"qos_id\": \"1\",

"cell_id": "X" // Policy for Cell X, where X is one of A, B, C or D

    },

    \"statement\": {

      \"carrier_id_list\": \"Arfcn_1\",

      \"preference\": \"Prefer\",

      \"primary\": true // Control plane on Carrier Arfcn_1 (becoming
Primary Component Carrier)

    },

}

{

    \"policy_id\": \"2\",

    \"scope\": {

      \"ue_id\": \"1\",

      \"slice_id\": \"1\",

      \"qos_id\": \"9\",

"cell_id": "X" // Policy for Cell X, where X is one of A, B, C or D

    },

    \"statement\": {

      \"carrier_id_list \": \"Arfcn_1\",

      \"preference\": \"Avoid\",

      \"primary\": false // Avoid MBB on Carrier Arfcn_1, and no carrier
in the carrier_id_list is to be used as secondary component carrier.
That is said, Arfcn_1 is not used as secondary component carrier,
because it is already used for primary component carrier as the policy 1
stated.

    },

    \"statement\": {

      \"carrier_id_list\": "Arfcn_2",

      \"preference\": \"Prefer\",

      \"primary\": false // Prefer MBB on Carrier Arfcn_2, and Arfcn_2
is used as secondary component carrier

    }

}

### 4.1.6 Enrichment information example

Radio fingerprint is composed of multiple virtual grids. The virtual
grids are constructed based on the historical report of intra-frequency
and inter-frequency measurement results of UEs from both the serving
cell and the neighbor cell. The serving cell is divided into multiple
grids according to the signaling measurement difference. It can be seen
as a kind of different space partition method which is different with
the traditional space partition method based on geographical location.
To construct the radio fingerprint, the grid index and the grid
attributes need to be defined. The grid index is to identify a specific
virtual grid and this index consists of cell ID and corresponding
coverage quality, e.g., RSRP segment ID, of at least three
intra-frequency cells. The grid attributes are used to describe the
wireless characteristics of the grid, such as coverage of
inter-frequency neighbor cells, including RSRP, Reference Signal
Receiving Quality (RSRQ), Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI),
Channel Quality Indicator (CQI), Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS),
beam ID, etc., handover performance indicators, and so on. The virtual
grids of the radio fingerprint are shown in figure 4.1.6-1.

### 4.1.7 A1 usage example in multi-access environment

The Non-RT RIC can send policies for traffic distribution in a
multi-access environment based on UE characteristics and traffic
patterns for different services that can be identified by their 5QI. The
following example scenario illustrates this, in which there are three
UEs with the following characteristics.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| UE Identifier  | UE Id=1,       | UE Id=2,       | UE Id=3,       |
|                | S-NSSAI =1     | S-NSSAI =2     | S-NSSAI =3     |
+================+================+================+================+
| User Traffic   | 5QI=1: Voice   | 5QI=1: Voice   | 5QI=1: Voice   |
|                |                |                |                |
|                | 5QI=8: FTP,    | 5QI=8: Email   | 5QI=8:         |
|                | Email          |                | Progressive    |
|                |                | 5QI=83:        | video          |
|                |                | Advanced       |                |
|                |                | driving        | 5QI=8: File    |
|                |                |                | sharing        |
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| Mobility       | Stationary     | High mobility  | Low mobility   |
| Pattern        |                |                |                |
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

The UEs are in an area covered by three frequency bands identified by
cell A, cell B and cell C respectively. Cell A is the macro licensed
cell with the best coverage. Cell B is the unlicensed cell with limited
coverage and cell C is a licensed cell with narrow bandwidth but
provides greater coverage area than cell B.

The cell layout for multi-access use case is shown in figure 4.1.7-1.

Figure 4.1.7-1: Cell layout for multi-access use case

From a traffic distribution perspective, since UE with UE Id=1 is a
stationary UE the FTP and email traffic with (5QI=8) should preferably
be routed over secondary unlicensed cell B and should avoid licensed
cells, cell A and cell C. The voice traffic should be routed over cell
A.

For UE with UE Id=2, since it is a highly mobile UE, all the traffic
should be routed over licensed cells, preferably cell A to avoid
disruption in connections. However, if there is a shortage of bandwidth
in cell A, the email traffic (5QI=8) can be routed over unlicensed band
(cell B). Given that this is a high mobility UE, there can be a policy
that a minimum of 50% and maximum of 70% of all traffic from this UE
should be routed over cell A which should be the primary cell and
remaining can be routed over secondary cell.

For UE with UE Id=3, since it is a low mobility UE both the progressive
video (5QI=8) and file sharing (5QI=8) should be routed over unlicensed
band (cell B). The voice traffic should be routed over cell A.

The following policies are needed to accomplish this as described in
JSON format below.

-   Policy Id 1: For group of UEs with UE Id, 1, 2 and 3. It sets the
    preference for voice traffic (5QI=1) on cell A for all the UEs.
    Further, dual connectivity should be enabled for all these UEs
    whenever possible.

-   Policy Id 2: For group of UEs with UE Id, 1 and 3. It sets the
    preference for all traffic with (5QI=8) on cell B for both the UEs
    and also avoids cell A and cell C for routing this traffic.

-   Policy Id 3: For UE with UE Id=2. It sets the preference for
    advanced driving traffic with (5QI=83) on cell A and C and also
    avoids cell B for routing this traffic.

-   Policy Id 4: For UE with UE Id=2. It sets the preference for email
    traffic with (5QI=8) on cell A and C for the high mobility UE.
    However, it does not avoid use of cell B for routing this traffic in
    case of bandwidth limitation.

-   Policy Id 5: For UE with UE Id=2. It sets the preference that
    minimum of 50% and a maximum of 70% of all traffic from this UE
    should be routed through cell A for this UE.

## 4.2 QoE optimization

This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN
architecture to support real-time QoE optimization. Moreover, some
high-level description and requirements over Non-RT RIC, A1 and E2
interfaces are introduced.

### 4.2.1 Background and goal of the use case

The highly demanding 5G native applications such as cloud VR are both
bandwidth consuming and latency sensitive. However, for such
traffic-intensive and highly interactive applications, current
semi-static QoS framework cannot efficiently satisfy diversified QoE
requirements especially taking into account potentially significant
fluctuation of radio transmission capability. It is expected that QoE
estimation/prediction from application level can help deal with such
uncertainty and improve the efficiency of radio resources, and
eventually improve user experience.

The main objective is to ensure QoE optimization be supported within the
O-RAN architecture and its open interfaces. Multi-dimensional data,
e.g., user traffic data, QoE measurements, network measurement report,
can be acquired and processed via ML algorithms to support traffic
recognition, QoE prediction, and QoS enforcement decisions. ML models
can be trained offline and model inference will be executed in a
real-time manner. Focus should be on a general solution that would
support any specific QoE use case (e.g., cloud VR, video, etc.).

### 4.2.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

1)  Non-RT RIC:

    a.  Retrieve necessary QoE related measurement metrics from network
        level measurement report and SMO (can acquire data from
        application) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML model that
        will be deployed in Near-RT RIC to assist in the QoE
        optimization function. For example, this could be application
        classification, QoE prediction, and available bandwidth
        prediction.

    b.  Training of potential ML models for predictive QoE optimization,
        which can respectively autonomously recognize traffic types,
        predict quality of experience, or predict available radio
        bandwidth.

    c.  Send policies/intents to Near-RT RIC to drive the QoE
        optimization at RAN level in terms of expected behavior.

2)  Near-RT RIC:

    a.  Support update of AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC.

    b.  Support execution of the AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC, e.g.,
        application classification, QoE prediction, and available
        bandwidth prediction.

    c.  Support interpretation and execution of intents and policies
        from Non-RT RIC to derive the QoE optimization at RAN level in
        terms of expected behavior.

    d.  Sending QoE performance report to Non-RT RIC for evaluation and
        optimization.

3)  E2 nodes:

    a.  Support network state and UE performance report with required
        granularity to SMO over O1 interface.

    b.  Support QoS enforcement based on messages from A1/E2, which are
        expected to influence RRM behavior.

### 4.2.4 Required data

Multi-dimensional data are expected to be retrieved by Non-RT RIC for
AI/ML model training and policies/intents generation.

1)  Network level measurement report, including:

    -   UE level radio channel information, mobility related metrics

    -   L2 measurement report related to traffic pattern, e.g.,
        throughput, latency, packets per-second, inter frame arrival
        time

    -   RAN protocol stack status: e.g., PDCP buffer status

    -   Cell level information: e.g., DL/UL PRB occupation rate

2)  QoE related measurement metrics collected from SMO (can acquire data
    from application or network).

3)  User traffic data, which can be obtained via a proprietary interface
    from existing data collection equipment and is currently out of the
    scope of A1 or E2.

### 4.2.5 A1 usage example

There are 3 examples to explain how A1 policy woks for QoE optimization.

One is for ue_id (100), slice_id (1) and qos_id (5QI =50), the target
QoE score (for example video MOS 80) should be satisfied.

{

    \"policy_id\": \"1\",

    \"scope\": {

      \"ue_id\": \"100\",

      \"slice_id\": \"1\",

      \"qos_id\": \"50\"

    },

    \"statement\": {

     \"qoe_score\": \"80\"

    }

}

The second example is to regulate specific QoE targets, for example,
initial buffering time for video streaming is required within 2 seconds,
rebuffering frequency is 2 times and stalling ratio is 5% for a
customized time window (e.g., 30 seconds).

{

    \"policy_id\": \"2\",

    \"scope\": {

      \"ue_id\": \"101\",

      \"slice_id\": \"1\",

      \"qos_id \": \"51\"

    },

    \"statement\": {

\"initial_buffering\": "2",

\"reBuffFreq\":"2",

\"stallRatio\": "5"

}

}

The specific user id need not be required, and only slice_id and flow_id
are required for specific QoE targets.

{

    \"policy_id\": \"3\",

    \"scope\": {

      \"slice_id\": \"1\",

      \"flow_id\": \"51\"

    },

    \"statement\": {

\"initial_buffering\":"2",

\"reBuffFreq\":"2",

\"stallRatio\": "5"

}

}

## 4.3 QoS based resource optimization

This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN
architecture to support RAN QoS based resource optimization. Moreover,
some high-level description and requirements over Non-RT RIC and A1
interfaces are introduced.

### 4.3.1 Background and goal of the use case

QoS based resource optimization can be used when the network has been
configured to provide some kind of preferential QoS for certain users.
One such scenario can be related to when the network has been configured
to support e2e slices. In this case, the network has functionality that
ensures resource isolation between slices as well as functionality to
monitor that slice Service Level Specifications (SLS) are fulfilled.

In RAN, it is the scheduler that ensures that Physical Resource Block
(PRB) resources are isolated between slices in the best possible way and
also that the PRB resources are used in an optimal way to best fulfill
the SLS for different slices. The desired default RAN behavior for
slices is configured over O1. For example, the ratio of physical
resources (PRBs) reserved for a slice is configured at slice creation
(instantiation) over O1. Also, QoS can be configured to guide the RAN
scheduler how to (in real-time) allocate PRB resources to different
users to best fulfill the SLS of a specific slice. In the NR NRM this is
described by the resource partition attribute.

Instantiation of a RAN sub-slice will be prepared by rigorous planning
to understand to what extent deployed RAN resources will be able to
support RAN sub-slice SLS. Part of this procedure is to configure RAN
functionality according to above. With this, a default behavior of RAN
is obtained that will be able to fulfill slice SLSs for most situations.
However, even through rigorous planning, there will be times and places
where the RAN resources are not enough to fulfill SLS given the default
configuration. To understand how often (and where) this happens, the
performance of a RAN slice will continuously be monitored by SMO. When
SMO detects a situation when RAN SLS cannot be fulfilled, Non-RT RIC can
use A1 policies to improve the situation. To understand how to utilize
A1 policies and how to resolve the situation, the Non RT-RIC will use
additional information available in SMO.

Take an emergency service as an example of a slice tenant. For this
example, it is understood (at slice instantiation) that 50% of the PRBs
in an area can be enough to support the emergency traffic under normal
circumstances. Therefore, the ratio of PRBs for the emergency users is
configured to 50% as default behavior for the pre-defined group of users
belonging to the emergency slice. Also, QoS is also configured in core
network and RAN so that video cameras of emergency users get a minimum
bitrate of 500 kbps.

Now, suppose a large fire is ongoing and emergency users are on duty.
Some of the personnel capture the fire on video on site. The video
streams are available to the emergency control command. Because of the
high traffic demand in the area from several emergency users (belonging
to the same slice), the resources available for the emergency slice is
not enough to support all the traffic. In this situation, the operator
has several possibilities to mitigate the situation. Depending on SLAs
towards the emergency slice compared to SLAs for other slices, the
operator could reconfigure the amount of PRB reserved to emergency slice
at the expense of other slices. However, there is always a risk that
emergency video quality is not good enough irrespective if all resources
are used for emergency users. It might be that no video shows sufficient
resolution due to resource limitations around the emergency site.

In this situation, the emergency control command decides, based on the
video content, to focus on a selected video stream to improve the
resolution. The emergency control system gives the information about
which users to up- and down-prioritize to the E2E slice assurance
function (through e.g., an edge API) of the mobile network to increase
bandwidth for selected video stream(s). Given this additional
information, the Non-RT RIC can influence how RAN resources are
allocated to different users through a QoS target statement in an A1
policy. By good usage of the A1 policy, the emergency control command
can ensure that dynamically defined group of UEs provides the video
resolution that is needed.

The use case can be summarized as per below:

1.  A fire draws a lot of emergency personnel to an area.

2.  Because of this, RAN resources becomes congested which affects the
    video quality for all video feeds in the area.

3.  The emergency control command have 5 active video feeds and selects
    one video feed which is of specific interest.

4.  The emergency control command requests higher resolution of a
    selected feed, while demoting the other.

5.  With this information, the Non-RT RIC will evaluate how to ensure
    higher bandwidth for the feed selected by emergency control command
    (and lower for other feeds).

6.  The Non-RT RIC updates the policy for the associated UEs in the
    associated Near-RT RIC over the A1 interface.

7.  Near-RT RIC enforce the modified QoS target for the associated UEs
    over the E2 interface to fulfil the request.

8.  The emergency control command experiences a higher resolution of the
    selected video feed.

### 4.3.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

1)  Non-RT RIC:

    a.  Monitor necessary QoS related metrics from network function and
        other SMO functions.

    b.  Send policies to Near-RT RIC to drive QoS based resource
        optimization at RAN level in terms of expected behavior.

2)  Near-RT RIC:

    a.  Support interpretation and execution of A1 policies for QoS
        based resource optimization.

3)  E2 nodes:

    a.  Support network state and UE performance report with required
        granularity to SMO over O1 interface.

    b.  Support QoS enforcement based on messages from E2, which are
        expected to influence RRM behavior.

+------------------+----------------------------------+--------------+

case

### 4.3.4 Required data

For this use case, different kind of observability need to be reported
to Non-RT RIC. First Non-RT RIC shall monitor resource consumption in
the area. As long as resource consumption is low, the RAN scheduler will
be able to give all users in an area the needed resources. When resource
consumption in an area increases above a threshold, there is risk of
that the default configuration of RAN will not be enough to fulfil the
requirements. At this point, the Non-RT RIC need to be able to configure
more detailed reporting for individual UEs that the Non-RT RIC is
interested in. This detailed observability should provide the Non RT RIC
better insight in performance for specific users and therefore includes
observability of e.g., user throughput and delay. With this more
detailed observability, the Non-RT RIC can understand when
pre-configured priorities are not enough for the scheduler to solve the
problem and when additional (non-RAN) information to solve the
prioritization is needed.

### 4.3.5 A1 usage example

**Example scenario**

-   One emergency RAN sub-slice defined (S-NSSAI=1) with a ratio of 50%
    configured. 5QI=74 configured for a minimum bitrate of 500 kbps.

-   4 UEs (UeId=10, 11, 12, 13) in the area which belongs to S-NSSAI = 1
    and with active flows of 5QI = 74.

-   Resource shortage means that minimum bitrate 500 kbps cannot be
    fulfilled for all users.

-   E2E Slice assurance function indicates to Non-RT RIC that UeId=10
    and 12 needs to be prioritized.

-   Because of resource shortage, increasing minimum bitrate for UeId=10
    and 12 will not improve, instead minimum bitrate for other users in
    slice needs to be lowered.

-   An alternative way to temporarily change RAN behavior for S-NSSAI=1
    users is to change the relative priority in the scheduler. This
    would change the relative resource assignment to different users
    with different priority.

## 4.4 Context-based dynamic HO management for V2X

This use case provides the background, motivation, and requirements for
the context-based dynamic HO management for V2X use case, allowing
operators to adjust radio resource allocation policies through the O-RAN
architecture, reducing latency and improving radio resource utilization.

### 4.4.1 Background and goal of the use case

V2X communication allows for numerous potential benefits such as
increasing the overall road safety, reducing emissions, and saving time.
Part of the V2X architecture is the V2X UE (SIM + device attached to
vehicle) which communicates with the V2X Application Server (V2X AS).
The exchanged information comprises Cooperative Awareness Messages
(CAMs) (from UE to V2X AS) \[i.2\], radio cell IDs, connection IDs, and
basic radio measurements (RSRP, RSPQ, etc.)

As vehicles traverse along a highway, due to their high speed and the
heterogeneous natural environment V2X UEs are handed over frequently, at
times in a suboptimal way, which can cause handover (HO) anomalies:
e.g., short stay, ping-pong, and remote cell. Such suboptimal HO
sequences substantially impair the functionality of V2X applications.
Since HO sequences are mainly determined by the Neighbor Relation Tables
(NRTs), maintained by the xNBs, there is hardly room for UE-level
customization.

This UC aims to present a method to avoid and/or resolve problematic HO
scenarios by using past navigation and radio statistics in order to
customize HO sequences on a UE level. To this end, the AI/ML
functionality that is enabled by the Near-RT RIC is employed.

### 4.4.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

1)  Non-RT RIC:

    a.  Retrieve necessary performance, configuration, and other data
        for constructing/training relevant AI/ML models that will be
        deployed in Near-RT RIC to assist in the V2X HO management
        function. For example, this could be a clustering algorithm that
        classifies traffic situations and radio conditions that
        (probably) do or do not lead to HO anomalies.

    b.  Support deployment and update of AI/ML models into Near-RT RIC
        xApp.

    c.  Support communication of intents and policies (system-level and
        UE-level) from Non-RT RIC to Near-RT RIC.

    d.  Support communication of non-RAN data to enrich control
        functions in Near-RT RIC (enrichment data).

2)  Near-RT RIC:

    a.  Support update of AI/ML models retrieved from Non-RT RIC.

    b.  Support interpretation and execution of intents and policies
        from Non-RT RIC.

    c.  Support necessary performance, configuration, and other data for
        defining and updating intents and policies for tuning relevant
        AI/ML models.

    d.  Support communication of configuration parameters to RAN.

3)  E2 nodes:

    a.  Support data collection with required granularity to SMO over O1
        interface.

    b.  Support near-real-time configuration-based optimization of HO
        parameters over E2 interface.

    c.  Report necessary performance, configuration, and other data for
        performing real-time V2X HO optimization in the Near-RT RIC over
        E2 interface.

4)  V2X application server:

    a.  Support data collection with required granularity from V2X UE
        over V1 interface.

    b.  Support communication of real-time traffic related data about
        V2X UE to Non-RT RIC as enrichment data.

### 4.4.4 Required data

The measurement counters and KPIs (as defined by 3GPP) should be
appropriately aggregated by cell, QoS type, slice, etc.

1)  Measurement reports with RSRP/RSRQ/CQI information for serving and
    neighboring cells.

2)  UE connection and mobility/handover statistics with indication of
    successful and failed handovers and error codes, etc.

3)  V2X related data: position, velocity, direction, navigation data,
    CAMs.

### 4.4.5 Proposed solution(s)

#### 4.4.5.1 Workflow overview

The use case workflow consists of these main components:

1\. **Data collection & maintenance**: This is required at Non-RT RIC
(over O1 and Enrichment Interface (EI)). Required radio measurements and
V2X related metrics are collected over a longer period of time
(sufficient to facilitate model training). The O1/EI data collection is
used for offline training of models, as well as for generating A1
policies for V2X HO optimization. The E2 (and EI) data collection is
used for model execution in the Near-RT RIC. Details of the models are
described below.

2\. **Long-term HO analytics & model maintenance:** The Non-RT RIC
long-term analytics is responsible for providing the relevant models for
V2X HO optimization over A1 interface. Based on O-RAN A1 interface specs
v1, these policies can be defined at per-UE level, UE group level, cell
or xNB level etc. This will provide the optimization scope/objective for
the Near-RT RIC V2X HO xApp. The xApp hosts two AI/ML-assisted
functions: 1. HO anomaly detection & prediction, 2. HO anomaly
avoidance. The 1. trained model\'s input is \[E2: HO sequences, UE radio
measurements; EI: position, velocity, direction, (O) navigation data,
(O) cell load data of cells in the area\] of a given time window, while
the output is \[anomaly likelihoods for possible future HO sequences\].
The 2. trained model\'s **input** is \[E2 report, EI report, output of
1. model, (O) navigation data, (O) cell load data of cells in the area\]
and its **output** is \[UE-customized NRT sequence for cells that the UE
is about to touch, with lower anomaly likelihood, (O) with validity
time\]. The two models are regularly retrained/updated based on new
radio/V2X data.

4\. **HO anomaly prediction & detection**: The navigation information
and HO sequence and predicted HO sequence of V2X UEs in scope are
evaluated and HO anomalies are detected or predicted. If any, it is
delegated for further consideration for HO sequence optimization.

5\. **HO sequence optimization**: Based on the E2 and enrichment reports
and the prediction/detection output, the trained AI/ML model outputs
UE-customized NRTs for the cells that I. are in scope, II. the UE is
about to come in touch with.

6\. **V2X HO optimization execution**: The new NRTs are deployed at xNBs
through E2 policies.

#### 4.4.5.2 Overview of ML models

While many combinations and deployments are possible, this proposal
outlines one specific set of models and analytics that can be useful to
drive such a use case.

**NonRT_Model1:** The Non-RT RIC ML-assisted solution uses the O1-based
and EI-based data collection to monitor the V2X UE HO performance
metrics and the navigation indicators (position, direction, speed, (O)
traffic indicators). Based on the performance monitoring, the model aims
to represent navigation and radio environments/conditions and maintain a
data base in order to classify HO situations. **Input:** historical
radio, HO, and location, direction, velocity data. **Output:**
maintained database with locations, directions, velocities and cells, HO
situations, HO anomalies, and/or sequences of all these, together with
prevalence rates (=estimated probabilities).

**NearRT_Model1:** The first ML-assisted near-RT xApp model in the
Near-RT RIC aims to rate/score future/current HO situations (on a UE
level) based on real-time radio (E2) and navigation conditions (EI),
i.e., predict/detect anomalous HO situations. **Input:** per-UE current
radio parameters, HO history, location, direction, velocity. **Output:**
predicted HO sequence(s) with probabilities for anomalies at specific
cell pairs.

**NearRT_Model2:** The second ML-assisted near-RT xApp model in the
Near-RT RIC aims to choose alternative, UE specific NRTs for a set of
cells and UEs so as to resolve or avoid anomalous HO situations.
**Input:** input and output of the NearRT_Model1. **Output:**
alternative, UE specific NRTs for some cells (e.g., with temporal
validity/expiration time).

### 4.4.6 A1 enrichment interface aspects

1\. As per ETSI EN 302 637-2 \[i.2\], V2X UE provides CAMs (which
include its GPS coordinates) on a 0.1-1s temporal granularity to the V2X
application server. The inference part of this use case depends on
accurate navigation data from V2X UEs, thus we expect this data to be
provided through the A1-EI without substantial processing or delay.

2\. The data (in particular the GPS coordinates) received over A1-EI
need to be correlated with RAN UE data. For this problem there might be
different requirements for the training data collection and the
inference data collection. E.g., the UE data association might be solved
using the ECGI + C-RNTI identifiers at any point in time (inference),
but when collecting historical data for training it is essential to save
the data in such a way that later correlation is possible as well.

### 4.4.7 A1 usage example

As of now the A1 aspect of the use case is confined to whether the HO
optimization is, within a certain scope, activated or not. Thus, some of
the attributes can overlap with the policy scope, but they are proposed
in order to allow for more fine-grained control (e.g., optimize for only
vehicles that are faster than 100 km/h \[vel_range\], between 7am and
9am on workdays \[time_range\], within a given geographical area \[pos
range\] or \[cell_id_list\].)

The proposed (optional) attributes of the statement type **v2x_nrt_opt**
are captured in table 4.4.7-1.

## 4.5 RAN slice SLA assurance

The 3GPP standards architected a sliceable 5G infrastructure which
allows creation and management of customized networks to meet specific
service requirements that can be demanded by future applications,
services and business verticals. Such a flexible architecture needs
different requirements to be specified in terms of functionality,
performance and group of users which can greatly vary from one service
to the other. The 5G standardization efforts have gone into defining
specific slices and their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on
application/service type as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\]. Since
network slicing is conceived to be an end-to-end feature that includes
the core network, the transport network and the Radio Access Network
(RAN), these requirements should be met at any slice subnet during the
life-time of a network slice as specified in 3GPP TS 28.530 \[3\],
especially in RAN side. Exemplary slice performance requirements are
specified in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, latency and
reliability at a high level in SDOs such as 3GPP TS 22.261 \[1\] and
GSMA \[9\]. These requirements are defined as a reference for
SLA/contractual agreements for each slice, which individually need
proper handling in NG-RAN.

Although network slicing support is started to be defined with 3GPP
Release 15, slice assurance mechanisms in RAN needs to be further
addressed to achieve deployable network slicing in an open RAN
environment. It is necessary to assure the SLAs by dynamically
controlling slice configurations based on slice specific performance
information. Existing RAN performance measurements as specified in 3GPP
TS 28.552 \[5\] and information model definitions as specified in 3GPP
TS 28.541 \[4\] are not enough to support RAN slice SLA assurance use
cases. This use case is intended to clarify necessary mechanisms and
parameters for RAN slice SLA assurance.

### 4.5.1 Background and goal of the use case

In the 5G era, network slicing is a prominent feature which provides
end-to-end connectivity and data processing tailored to specific
business requirements. These requirements include customizable network
capabilities such as the support of very high data rates, traffic
densities, service availability and very low latency. According to 5G
standardization efforts, the 5G system can support the needs of the
business through the specification of several service needs such as data
rate, traffic capacity, user density, latency, reliability, and
availability. These capabilities are always provided based on a Service
Level Agreement (SLA) between the mobile operator and the business
customer, which brought up interest for mechanisms to ensure slice SLAs
and prevent its possible violations. O-RAN's open interfaces and AI/ML
based architecture will enable such challenging mechanisms to be
implemented and help pave the way for operators to realize the
opportunities of network slicing in an efficient manner.

### 4.5.5 A1 usage example

**Example scenario 1**

-   One mobile leased line network slice for live broadcasting is
    defined (S-NSSAI=1).

-   The SLA for the slice is defined with the total UL/DL throughput of
    30 Mbps of the users in the slice provided in the coverage area
    (cellId=1, 2, 3).

-   Non-RT RIC generates A1 policy for Near-RT RIC slice SLA assurance,
    which includes S-NSSAI and cellId as scope identifiers, and
    per-slice total PDCP layer throughput target as a policy statement.

-   Near-RT RIC enforces the policy and guides RAN behavior via E2 to
    meet the slice SLA.

{

    \"PolicyId\": \"1\",

    \"scope\": {

      \"sliceId\": \"1\",

"cellId": "1", "2", "3", // Multiple cellIds need to be supported

    },

    \"statement\": {

      \"uLThptPerSlice\": \"30\"

> \"dLThptPerSlice\": \"30\"

    }

}

**Example scenario 2**

Background of the scenario

-   SLA violation occurs when a cell is congested, and not enough
    resources are allocated to slice users. To minimize this kind of SLA
    violation, load balancing is effective.

-   Although load balancing can be performed using traffic steering
    preference policy type, that approach is insufficient to reduce the
    load to desired level, because there will be a gap between the
    actual load and the load recognized by Non-RT RIC due to long
    monitoring and control interval of Non-RT RIC. As shown in figure
    4.5.5-1, the near-real-time control loop can achieve smaller
    reaction time than the non-real-time control loop. Therefore, it is
    preferable to use Near-RIC for load balancing.

-   In this scenario, by using A1 policy for load balancing, the load
    balancing is performed in a shorter cycle, which is more effective
    in assuring slice SLAs.

Near-RT RIC and E2 nodes

> Overall flow in the scenario

-   In this scenario, Non-RT RIC monitors the load and performance under
    the cell and decides whether the cell load should be balanced or
    not. Only when cell congestion is detected or predicted, A1 policy
    for load balancing is sent to Near-RT RIC, and Near-RT RIC performs
    cell load balancing to ease the cell congestion and solve SLA
    violation.

-   The following example describes the overall steps in load balancing
    to assure slice SLAs defined by delay requirement. Note that the
    step number corresponds to the number given in figure 4.5.5-2.

(1) An A1 policy (PolicyId: 1) corresponding to SLA of slice \#1, which
    includes delay requirement per UE for users of cell A\~E, and slice
    \#1, is sent from Non-RT RIC to Near-RT RIC.

(2) To monitor the cell load and performance of delay, Non-RT RIC
    > collects mean DL PRB used for data traffic (as specified in 3GPP
    > TS 28.552 \[5\], clause 5.1.1.2.5) from cell A\~E, and
    > distribution of delay DL air-interface (per S-NSSAI) (as specified
    > in 3GPP TS 28.552 \[5\], clause 5.1.1.1.2) from cell A\~E via O1.

(3) In Non-RT RIC, when the load of cell A is high, and the percentage
    > of packets of slice \#1 experiencing a longer delay than required,
    > Non-RT RIC determines that the SLA violation is due to high load
    > and decides to start load balancing. Non-RT RIC sends an A1 policy
    > (PolicyId: 2) to transfer the load of cell A to neighboring
    > non-congested cells (cell B, D and E) until the load of cell A
    > becomes smaller than 80%.

(4) To monitor the load and radio quality, Near-RT RIC collects mean DL
    > PRB used for data traffic (as specified in 3GPP TS 28.552 \[5\],
    > clause 5.1.1.2.5) from cell A\~E, and per-UE RSRP measurement and
    > RSRQ measurement (as specified in E2SM-KPM \[16\], clauses
    > 8.2.1.2.2, 8.2.1.2.3 and in 3GPP TS 28.552 \[5\], clauses
    > 5.1.1.22, 5.1.1.31) via E2.

(5) Near-RT RIC decides the combination of UEs to be handed over and
    > target cells based on the information collected in (4). Near-RT
    > RIC sends E2 CONTROL for UE-level hand over control to decrease
    > the load of cell A below 80%.

(6) Non-RT RIC continues to monitor the cell load and performance. When
    > Non-RT RIC decides that the cell load becomes low enough to not
    > cause SLA violation, it notifies deletion of the policy
    > (PolicyId: 2) to Near-RT RIC.

### 4.5.6 O1 usage example

**Example scenario**

-   One mobile leased line network slice for live broadcasting is
    defined (S-NSSAI=1).

-   The SLA for the slice is defined with the average total UL/DL
    throughput of 30 Mbps of the users in the slice provided in the
    coverage area (cellId=1, 2, 3).

-   Note that O1 configuration is used to assure SLAs defined as long
    term performance values such as average throughput, which do not
    need frequent reconfiguration.

-   In order to calculate the number of required PRBs to meet throughput
    requirement of the slice, Non-RT RIC collects wideband CQI
    distribution and data volume in UL/DL via O1. The calculated value
    is converted to the portion of PRB allocation to the slice i.e.,
    rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio (as specified in 3GPP TS 28.541 \[4\]).

-   Non-RT RIC sends rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio as O1 reconfiguration
    requests to E2 nodes.

-   Non-RT RIC also collects UL/DL PRB used for data traffic and average
    UL/DL UE throughput in gNB. When the PRB usage becomes low, Non-RT
    RIC reconfigures rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio via O1 to decrease the
    allocated PRBs. When the PRB usage becomes high and throughput
    deterioration occurs, Non-RT RIC reconfigures
    rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio via O1 to increase the allocated PRBs.

The illustration of the RRMPolicy reconfiguration via O1 is given in
figure 4.5.6-1.

## 4.6 NSSI resource allocation optimization

This use case provides the background, objectives, solution, and
requirements for the NSSI resource optimization, an rApp implemented in
Non-RT RIC, which leverages AI/ML inference on slice performance
measurement data to determine the actions to automatically optimize the
resource allocation for network slice instances.

### 4.6.1 Background and goal of the use case

Network slicing is essential to 5G, as it enables many new services
across manufacturing, autonomous driving, gaming, and many more via the
provision of ultra-low latency in URLLC and huge data volume in eMBB
features that require different or contrasting QoS requirements
exploiting a shared RAN node. The goal of this use case is to ensure the
resources are allocated dynamically and efficiently among multiple
network slices sharing the RAN node.

As the new 5G services have different characteristics, the network
traffic tends to be sporadic, where there can be different usage pattern
in terms of time, location, UE distribution, and types of applications.
For example, most IoT sensor applications can run during off-peak hours
or weekends. Special events, such as sport games, concerts, can cause
traffic demand to shoot up at certain time and locations. Cars with
autonomous driving capability tend to require more URLLC services in the
morning or afternoon rush hours in major freeways in big cities, while
subscribers tend to consume eMBB services to watch video streaming at
night in residential areas. Therefore, NSSI resource optimization rApp
trains the AI/ML model, based on the huge volume of performance data
collected over days, weeks, months from O-RAN nodes. It then performs
inference function on the model with input measurements to predict the
traffic demand patterns of 5G networks in different times and locations
for each network slice, and automatically optimize the resource
allocation for network slice instances accordingly.

### 4.6.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

1)  Non-RT RIC:

    a.  Receive measurements to monitor the usage of RRM resources
        > (e.g., PRB, RRC, DRB) identified by S-NSSAI from E2 nodes via
        > the O1 interface.

    b.  Perform the model training with input measurements data received
        > from E2 nodes to create the model.

    c.  Perform the inference function on the model with the input
        > measurements data to determine if any actions shall be
        > executed to update the resources on the E2 nodes.

    d.  Configure the resources at the E2 nodes via O1 interface.

    e.  Receive notifications from E2 nodes indicating the resource
        > re-configuration was done.

    f.  Update the O-Cloud resources via the O2 interface.

    g.  Receive notifications from O-Cloud indicating the resource was
        > updated.

2)  E2 nodes (O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, D-DU):

    a.  Support the collections and reporting of measurements that are
        used to monitor the resource usage on per network slice basis
        via the O1 interface.

    b.  Support the re-configuration of attributes to update the
        resources allocated to each network slice via the O1 interface.

An example of two NSSIs, where NSSI\#1 groups E2 nodes (i.e., O-DU,
O-CU-CP, and O-CU-UP), and NSSI\#2 groups 5GC NFs is shown in figure
4.6.5-1. It also shows that two network slices, identified by S-NSSAI\#1
supporting URLLC, and S-NSSAI\#2 supporting eMBB. The goal of this use
case is to optimize the resources associated with RAN network slices.

**Figure 4.6.5-1: NSSI resource optimization example**

NSSI resources optimization rApp runs model inference with input
measurement data collected from E2 nodes for S-NSSAI\#1 and S-NSSAI\#2,
and detects a traffic pattern for O-DU serving an area with high density
of business and residential users at the time on a given day. An example
of PRB resource allocation for S-NSSAI\#1 and S-NSSAI\#2 at the O-DU is
shown in figure 4.6.5-2.

-   At 15:00, the dedicated resources and prioritized resources for
    S-NSSAI\#1 were increased to 20% and 50% respectively for as more
    cars demand more URLLC services at the start of rush hours.

-   At 17:00, the dedicated resources, prioritized resources, and shared
    resources for S-NSSAI\#1 were further increased as the rush hours
    traffic getting worse.

-   At 19:00, the dedicated resources, prioritized resources, and shared
    resources for S-NSSAI\#2 were increased to 20%, 60%, and 75%
    respectively as more residential users demand more eMBB services for
    home video streaming.

-   At 20:00, the dedicated resources, prioritized resources, and shared
    resources for S-NSSAI\#1 were decreased as the rush hours traffic
    coming to end.

-   At 21:00, the dedicated resources, prioritized resources, and shared
    resources for S-NSSAI\#2 were further increased as the demand for
    eMBB services increased.

-   At 22:00, the dedicated resources, prioritized resources, and shared
    resources for S-NSSAI\#1were decreased as the demand for URLLC
    services further reduced.

-   At 24:00, the dedicated resources, prioritized resources, and shared
    resources for S-NSSAI\#2 were decreased to 10%, 25%, and 60%
    respectively as the demand for eMBB services further reduced.

## 4.7 Massive MIMO optimization

Massive MIMO optimization is one of the top priority use cases in O-RAN.
Several massive MIMO sub-features have been proposed and studied during
the massive MIMO pre-normative study, which is documented in the
O-RAN.WG1.MMIMO-USE-CASES-TR-v01.00 \[i.3\], including the potential
data requirements for each of the sub-use cases. The following
sub-clauses provide the background, objectives, solutions, deployment
options, and identified WG2 requirements for massive MIMO sub-features

### 4.7.1 Massive MIMO Grid-of-Beams Beamforming (GoB BF) optimization

#### 4.7.1.1 Background and goal of the use case

Massive MIMO (mMIMO) is among the key methods to increase performance
and QoS in 5G networks. Capacity enhancement is obtained by means of
beamforming of the transmitted signals, and by spatially multiplexing
data streams. Beamforming can increase the received signal power and
simultaneously decrease the interference generated for other users,
hence resulting in higher SINR and higher user throughputs.
Grid-of-Beams (GoB) with the corresponding beam sweeping has been
introduced to allow beamforming of the control channels used during
initial access as well as for data transmission and reception, mainly
for high frequency (but can be used also for the sub-6 GHz band) MIMO
operation. The physical properties of the antenna array and its possible
configurations characterize the span of the beams, namely the horizontal
and vertical aperture in which beamforming is supported, and therefore
the coverage area and the shape of the cell. mMIMO can be deployed in 5G
macrocell clusters as well as in heterogeneous networks, where
macrocells and small cells co-exist and complement each other for better
aggregated capacity and coverage. In order to obtain optimal beamforming
and cell resources (Tx power, PRB) configuration, one will have to look
at a multi-cell environment instead of a single cell. Moreover,
different vendors can have different implementations in terms of the
number of beams, the horizontal/vertical beam widths, azimuth and
elevation range, to achieve the desired coverage. In a
multi-node/multi-vendor scenario, centralized monitoring and control is
required to offer optimal coverage, capacity and mobility performance as
well as control over electromagnetic emissions in order to comply with
regulatory requirements.

The problem associated with traditional mMIMO BF is that its performance
is highly dependent on the choice of the Beam Forming (BF) pattern.
Manual configuration is usually based on the empirical knowledge and
manual test results of the domain expert(s) and is performed in a
semi-static way. That is, (near-)real time contextual, per-site
information (such as cell geometry change, user/traffic distribution,
mobility patterns, seasonalities etc.) is taken into account in a
suboptimal and non-real-time way. This can cause one or more of the
following problems:

1.  High inter-cell interference.

2.  Unbalanced traffic between neighboring cells.

3.  Low performance at the cell edges or throughout the cell.

4.  Poor handover performance.

This solution proposes a framework that allows the operator to flexibly
configure the mMIMO BF parameters in a cell or in a cluster of cells by
means of policies and configuration assisted by Machine Learning (ML)
techniques. The configuration optimization relies on contextual
information and patterns such as the user distribution, traffic demand
distribution, cell geometries, and mobility.

#### 4.7.1.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

1)  SMO & Non-RT RIC Framework (FW):

    a.  Collect the necessary configurations, performance indicators,
        and measurement reports from the E2 nodes (O-DU), triggered by
        Non-RT RIC FW if required.

    b.  Transfer collected data towards rApp.

    c.  Provide optimized mMIMO GoB parameters via O1 (to O-DU) or open
        FH M-plane (to O-RU) interface.

    d.  Optional: Retrieve necessary enrichment information (UE location
        related information, e.g., GPS coordinates) for the purpose
        of i) training relevant rApps and ii) execution of relevant
        rApps.\
        NOTE: Exposure of enrichment information to rApps is not defined
        in the present document.

    e.  Monitor the performance of the respective cells; when the
        optimization objective fails, initiate fallback procedure and/or
        trigger the rApp model retraining and re-optimization.

    f.  Execute the inference/control loop periodically or
        event-triggered.

    g.  Optional: The ML model training can be done by the Non-RT RIC
        FW.

2)  rApps:

    a.  Retrieve the necessary configurations, performance indicators,
        and measurement reports from the E2 nodes and necessary
        enrichment information via the SMO, for the purpose of training
        and execution of relevant AI/ML models.

    b.  Infer an optimized GoB BF configuration.

3)  E2 nodes & O-RU:

    a.  Collect and provide necessary measurements and KPIs to the SMO
        (see Required data clause).

    b.  Apply mMIMO GoB configuration received from the SMO.

NOTE: Both aggregated and disaggregated gNB architecture are supported.

#### 4.7.1.4 Required data

The specification of the data communicated over O1 is outside the scope
of WG2. There are no data that are relevant for the A1 interface.

### 4.7.2 Massive MIMO Non-GoB Beamforming (Non-GoB BF) optimization

This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN
architecture to support Non-Grid of Beams beamforming optimization.
Non-RT RIC could be used to train AI/ML models for Non-GoB BF selection
xApps, which intelligently recommend best Non-GoB BF modes to a O-gNB or
O-DU.

Note that non-AI/ML based solutions for Non-GoB BF optimization is not
precluded. The AI/ML model training, deployment, and inference described
below are not applicable to non-AI/ML based solutions.

#### 4.7.2.1 Background and goal of the use case

Non-GoB BF approaches are an important class of beamforming algorithms
for 5G massive MIMO deployments, especially for implementations in sub-6
GHz frequency bands. For example, beam weights can be computed at the
O-gNB or O-DU based on channel measurements of Sounding Reference
Signals (SRS) without predefined beam sets, assuming uplink and downlink
correspondence.

Noted that Non-GoB BF modes are not standardized, instead they are
vendor-specific proprietary algorithms. Multiple Non-GoB BF modes can be
implemented, as some modes perform better than others under particular
wireless conditions. Non-GoB BF modes can differ in the following
aspects:

-   MIMO modes (i.e., SU-MIMO or MU-MIMO)

-   Channel estimation algorithms

-   Beam weight calculation approaches (e.g., Matched Filter (MF),
    Zero-Forcing (ZF), eigen-beamforming, etc.)

-   Time and frequency granularity of beamforming, etc.

To select the best Non-GoB BF modes, the SMO/Non-RT RIC and the Near-RT
RIC are not required to understand the details of a specific Non-GoB BF
modes, e.g., how the beamforming weights are computed under a mode. They
only need to know how many Non-GoB BF modes are supported in the O-DU
and the performance of each mode.

The goal of this use case is therefore to provide an intelligent control
over multiple supported Non-GoB BF modes in order to recommend a
preferred mode to a BS as a function of wireless conditions, such as
channel quality, UE location and mobility, interference condition, PHY
layer configuration, etc.

#### 4.7.2.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

1)  SMO/Non-RT RIC:

    a.  Retrieve the number of supported Non-GoB BF modes in O-DU via
        the O1 interface.

    b.  Retrieve performance measurement data and UE context information
        (e.g., SRS periodicity) from O-DU via the O1 interface, for each
        Non-GoB BF mode.

    c.  Collect enrichment information from external sources such as
        application servers.

    d.  Associate enrichment information with collected measurements and
        configurations.

    e.  Perform model training.

    f.  Perform model deployment.

    g.  Perform model performance monitoring and model re-training.

    h.  Send enrichment information to the Near-RT RIC for inference via
        > the A1 interface.

Note that the model can be trained in the Non-RT RIC framework or in the
Non-GoB BF optimization rApp.

2)  Near-RT RIC:

    a.  Receive enrichment information via the A1 interface.

    b.  Support AI/ML model deployment from the SMO/Non-RT RIC.

    c.  Receive performance measurement data and UE context information
        (e.g., SRS periodicity) from O-DU via the E2 interface.

    d.  Associate enrichment information with collected measurements and
        configurations.

    e.  Select Non-GoB modes, e.g., by performing model inference.

    f.  Send Non-GoB BF control/policy message to O-DU via the E2
        > interface.

Note that the requirements of Near-RT RIC are under the scope of WG3.

3)  O-DU:

    a.  Send the number of supported Non-GoB BF modes to SMO/Non-RT RIC
        via the O1 interface.

    b.  Send measurement data and UE context information (e.g., SRS
        periodicity) to SMO/Non-RT RIC via the O1 interface.

    c.  Send measurement data and UE context information (e.g., SRS
        periodicity) to the Near-RT RIC via the E2 interface.

    d.  Support Non-GoB control/policy message received from the Near-RT
        > RIC via the E2 interface.

Note that the requirements of O1 interface for O-DU are under the scope
of WG5.

#### 4.7.2.3 Solutions

##### 4.7.2.3.1 AI/ML-assisted Non-GoB BF mode selection

Note that data collection over E2 interface and E2 control/policy
procedures shown in table 4.7.2.3.1-2 and in figure 4.7.2.3.1-2 are
under the scope of WG3. Note that external interface between the Non-RT
RIC and the external sources (e.g., application servers) is not
specified by O-RAN.

The context of the AI/ML-assisted Non-GoB BF mode selection -- model
training, deployment, and update is captured in table 4.7.2.3.1-1.

Figure 4.7.2.3.1-2: AI/ML-assisted Non-GoB BF mode selection - inference

#### 4.7.2.4 Required data

The specification of the data communicated over O1 is outside the scope
of WG2.

The following enrichment information from external sources (e.g.,
application server) are used in model training and inference:

-   UE location

-   UE mobility

-   Time granularity of the enrichment information reports (e.g.,
    integer multiple of a second)

Note that for model inference, above EI is sent from Non-RT RIC to
Near-RT RIC via the A1 interface.

#### 4.7.2.5 A1 enrichment information example

In training phase, the retrieved enrichment information (e.g., UE
mobility and location information) needs to be associated with collected
per-UE L1/L2 measurement reporting (e.g., L1-RSRP and/or L1-SINR, etc.)
and UE context information (e.g., UE-specific SRS periodicity) by the
Non-RT RIC. In the inference phase, such data association is performed
by the Near-RT RIC. Therefore, the EI delivered over the A1 interface
should contain necessary UE identification to facilitate the data
association at the Near-RT RIC. The Near-RT RIC shall be able to
recognize the UE identification and be able to map it to the UE
identification used over the E2 interface.

For example, the A1 enrichment information contains the following
information elements:

-   UE identifier

-   Position of the UE

-   Height of the UE

-   Time stamp when the position and height was recorded

### 4.7.3 MIMO optimization via MIMO DL Tx power optimization, MU-MIMO pairing, and MIMO mode selection

This use case will provide the objective, solutions, and data
requirements related to MIMO optimization based on three key
sub-features involving downlink transmit power, MIMO pairing enhancement
(user separability), and user MIMO mode selection (MU-MIMO or SU-MIMO)
that are described in detail in the O-RAN.WG1.MMIMO-USE-CASES-TR-v01.00
\[i.3\]. The use-case leverages Non-RT RIC to train and host the
relevant models and applications that rely on O1 interface services to
intelligently optimize MIMO capacity and user experience.

#### 4.7.3.1 Background and goal of the use case

##### 4.7.3.1.1 MIMO downlink transmit power optimization

For general downlink precoding, the downlink transmit power is usually
evenly distributed across the UEs. However, depending on the UE
separability and path loss deltas, this can result in good cell capacity
at the expense of individual UE quality. This can be due to several
issues such as cell edge UEs having general downlink SINR issues (even
without MU-MIMO), poor UE separability between cell edge UEs, and poor
uplink SINR resulting in degraded SRS which are a few example issues.
The result of these issues can be manifested by observations of very
poor individual UE SINRs (either downlink, uplink, or both) when running
in a MU-MIMO mode. Therefore, although the capacity of the cell has been
significantly increased, certain customer experiences can become
unacceptable in this MU-MIMO mode.

The solution to the problem described above is to simply provide
observations of UE performance in the form of periodic histograms of UE
channel quality as well as the overall cell capacity in order to compute
an optimal solution via AI/ML with control of the downlink minimum
required SINR threshold to achieve a minimal UE quality requirement that
is set by the operator. The minimum required SINR is a threshold
recommendation and thus doesn't require real time AI/ML adjustment of
transmit power directly but rather leaves this to the scheduler to
adjust and optimize consistent with its numerous other priorities and
requirements.

The value of this observability and adjustability allows the operator to
optimize the trade-off between cell capacity and individual
user/customer quality which is essential to provide the best customer
experience. The trade-off, for example, can reduce a very high cell
centre data rate (which would likely be unnoticeable for the user) to
allow more power to be allocated to the cell edge user (who is noticing
low tput and large latencies) to improve the cell edge data rate
situation.

##### 4.7.3.1.2 MU-MIMO pairing enhancement (user separability)

Existing channel orthogonality between multiple users is critical to
create user separability and allow for the opportunity to share radio
frequency resources simultaneously. Failing this, residual interference
will be too high to maintain adequate post pairing radio link signal
quality levels required to sustain MU-MIMO mode assignments. With
mobility there is an added demand to adjust beamforming weight
assignments to not only maintain signal power levels at the user end
(beam quality), but also to continuously limit the inter user
interference experienced between users assigned with the same radio
resource allocations. If these challenges are left unaddressed, a 5G
massive MIMO deployment will fail to utilize the full capability of
large antenna arrays powered by transceivers designed to transmit data
channel signals towards a spatially confined direction. Further, the
network will also fail to realize potential multiplexing gains as fewer
radio resource blocks are shared between users within the same cell,
reducing spectral efficiency.

Another important aspect is the need to efficiently identify users with
low demand for radio resources - sources of bursty traffic. An
intelligent assessment of how best such users can be effectively paired,
if at all, with other users, needs to be pre-determined by the RIC. In
summary, this use case suggests various measurement objects that are
recommended as input into the AI/ML analytics Apps to optimally
determine the outputs required to optimize the MU-MIMO feature
operation.

The AI/ML assisted modelling and training output, along with the Non-RT
RIC based enhancement/inference, will strive to deliver end goal
solution selections and system configuration options that upon adoption
within the respective domains where they reside, realize an optimization
framework that maximizes the potential of a MU-MIMO feature. Capacity
augmentation will be realized by successfully assigning MU-MIMO layers
to a greater number of users simultaneously, more often, and more
uniformly across the serving area of each gNB.

##### 4.7.3.1.3 MIMO mode selection optimization (MU-MIMO vs SU-MIMO selection)

A successful MU-MIMO operation involves the realization of as many
orthogonal radio frequency channel links between multiple spatially
separated users as possibly as supported by the implementation software
at the digital domain. Key to such realization is the successful
beamforming weight determination that enables not only the phase
addition of multipath signals at the user receiver, but also the choice
of precoding algorithms which limit the residual interference between
the paired users. It can make sense for the scheduler to prioritize the
assignment of radio resources to a MU-MIMO mode of operation during
periods of congestion or when high latency requiring applications are
supported (to free up other resources that can be assigned sooner).
However, doing so at the expense of undesirably lower spectral
efficiency on these assigned radio resources will reduce overall sector
throughput levels and create poor user experience. It is important to
find a means through the AI/ML agent to distinguish users and identify
sectors where optimal operation means a greater assignment of SU-MIMO
modes independently to users, especially those requiring higher
throughput, using devices that are capable of supporting higher layer
SU-MIMO count, and operating in an environment that sustains a greater
channel rank.

With increased loading massive MIMO systems will incur rising levels of
interference on the uplink from connected users and on the downlink from
the gNB. In addition to normal SINR measurements, the diagnosis of
interference from all spatial directions uniformly (white spatial noise)
versus specific directions (spatially correlated noise) will be of
interest and will require MIMO modes (SU-MIMO vs MU-MIMO) to be properly
selected for assignment on a user basis. Such implementation will
optimize the per user and per cell throughputs, taking into
consideration channel orthogonality conditions rank realizable, and per
user effective bandwidth requirement.

### 4.7.4 AI/ML-based initial access (SS Burst Set) configuration optimization

#### 4.7.4.1 Background and goal of the use case

3GPP NR based wireless cellular networks promises to provide leaner
system design compared to its predecessors in a bid to improve spectral
efficiency, power consumption performance and reduce interferences.
Ultra-lean design aims to minimize "always on" reference signal
transmissions in the downlink. Synchronization Signals Burst (SSB) sets
are one of the high-overhead "always on" reference signals. In large
scale NR networks with thousands of gNB/Transmission-Reception Points
(TRPs) deployed, system configurations derived statically/manually
aiming to accommodate worst case scenario which may arise only for a
small window of time can impact on the followings:

1.  Increased overhead i.e., degraded utilization of time-frequency
    > resources affecting Spectral Efficiency (SE).

2.  Increased interferences among the cells.

3.  Increased power consumptions in both network and UEs leading
    > increased network CAPEX and reduced UE battery life respectively.

In this context, this sub-use case proposes an AI/ML assisted
optimization framework wherein AI/ML agent/engine running at Non-RT RIC
can infer optimal SSB set configuration (i.e., number of SS blocks, SS
beam directions and SS burst periodicity) based on Configuration (CM)
parameters, Performance Measurements (PM), Key Performance Indicators
(KPI), and measurement report traces obtained from the E2 nodes
(O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-eNB) and O-RU. At high-level, the goal of the
optimization problem is to minimize SS signal transmissions overhead
i.e., determine the minimum number of SSB beams required, their
directions and periodicity subject to KPI (integrity, mobility, etc.)
targets.

The overall scheme can be summarized as follows. Based on the
history/trace/distribution of UE-specific beams (e.g., P2 beams), the
AI/ML engine determines the minimum number of SSB beams, their
directions and the maximum periodicity of the SS burst required to
achieve KPI targets as per history/trace/distribution of UE-specific
beams. Furthermore, in order to handle the lower probability occurrences
in the statistical models e.g., UEs appearing in a completely new
direction that has not been considered in the training data, the AI/ML
engine (if required) updates the optimal set (e.g., adds beam directions
that compliments the optimal directions, updates the SS burst
periodicity etc.). Finally, the AI/ML engine shares the optimized SSB
set configuration with gNB.

#### 4.7.4.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

1)  SMO & Non-RT RIC framework:

    a.  Collect the necessary Configuration (CM) parameters, Performance
        Measurements (PM), Key Performance Indicators (KPI), and
        measurement report traces from the E2 nodes (O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP,
        O-DU, O-eNB) and O-RU.

    b.  Allow the rApp to receive the CMs, PMs, KPIs measurement data
        (collected via O1) to perform the AI/ML model training and
        provide inference on the SSB set configuration parameters
        (number of SS blocks, SS beam directions and SS burst
        periodicity).

    c.  Write/update the optimized SSB set configuration via O1 (to
        O-DU) interface.

2)  rApps:

    a.  Retrieve the necessary Configuration (CM) parameters,
        Performance Measurements (PM), Key Performance Indicators (KPI),
        and measurement report traces pertaining to the E2 nodes and
        O-RU from the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework via R1 for the purpose of
        optimizing SSB set configuration.

    b.  Train AI/ML model to optimize the SSB set configurations.

    c.  Modify/update the SSB set configurations, optimized by the
        inference engine of the rApp, and write the configuration output
        to the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework via R1.

    d.  Monitor the performance of the respective cells. Upon KPI
        degradation, initiate rollback to the previous version of the
        AI/ML model, if any, and/or trigger the AI/ML model retraining.

    e.  Execute the inference/control loop periodically or on an
        event-triggered based.

3)  E2 nodes and O-RU:

    a.  Report the desired performance measurements and KPIs,
        configuration parameters and CM changes, trace reports and
        measurements to the SMO via O1.

    b.  Receive the optimized SSB set configurations from the SMO via O1
        and apply the configuration on the O-DU which may further
        exercise the configuration update on the O-RU.

NOTE: Both aggregated and disaggregated gNB architectures are supported.

## 4.8 Network energy saving

This clause contains the set of energy saving use cases.

### 4.8.1 Carrier and cell switch off/on

#### 4.8.1.1 Background and goal of the use case

Mobile networks often utilize multiple frequency layers (carriers) to
cover the same service area. At low load, i.e., when the expected
traffic volume is lower than a fixed threshold, ES can be achieved by
switching off one or more carriers or entire cells without impairing the
user experience. UEs previously served by the carrier or cell will be
offloaded by the E2 node(s) to a new target carrier or cell prior to the
switch off.

However, the switch off/on decisions are not a trivial task. There are
conflicting targets between system performance and energy savings. Other
carriers / cells will have to serve the additional traffic and traffic
is changing over time. E2 node(s) and O-RU(s) support several techniques
effecting energy consumption which might also be load dependent. While
energy savings for the switched off carrier/cell is maximized, the
overall energy consumption of the network might even increase.

Carrier and cell switch off/on control by the Non-RT or Near-RT RIC can
consider overall network energy efficiency instead of local
optimization. The switch off/on decision can optionally be made by an
AI/ML model within the inference host, deployed at the Non-RT RIC to
further improve decision making. Among others, the AI/ML models\'
functionality can include prediction of future traffic, user mobility,
and resource usage and can also predict expected energy efficiency
enhancements, resource usage, and network performance for different ES
optimization states. Also, with addition of per-UE geographical location
information such as trace record for immediate MDT measurement (as
specified in 3GPP TS 32.423 \[11\], clause 4.34.1) and trace record for
UE location information (as specified in 3GPP TS 32.423 \[11\], clause
4.34.2) as input data, the increased accuracy for UE location/trajectory
prediction could be expected for more efficient solution so that it
could prevent switched off cell(s) from being switched on even though
meaningful number of UEs generating/receiving traffic do not exist in
that cell(s). In that sense these collections could be conditionally
activated during some cells being switched off and be deactivated once
all cells switched on in terms of UE energy saving. Possible differences
among collected types of geographical location information such as
between MDT and LMF are expected to be absorbed and exposed to rApp(s)
based on R1 data type definition.

Before switching off/on carrier(s) or cell(s), there is a possibility
the E2 node(s) and O-RU(s) of performing some preparation actions for
off switching (e.g. check ongoing emergency calls and warning messages,
to enable, disable, modify carrier aggregation and/or dual connectivity,
to trigger HO traffic and UEs from cells/carriers to other cells or
carriers, informing neighbour nodes via X2/Xn interface, etc.) as well
as for on switching (e.g., cell probing, informing neighbour nodes via
X2/Xn interface, etc.).This solution proposes a framework that allows
the operator to flexibly configure carrier and cell switch off/on
parameters in a cell or in a cluster of cells through O1 configuration
formulated by rApp towards E2 node(s) and O-RU(s) or A1 policies
formulated by rApp towards Near-RT RIC through SMO/Non-RT RIC framework
assisted by machine learning (ML) techniques.

##### 4.8.1.3.2 A1 policy based carrier and cell switch off/on optimization for energy saving

In this solution, decision making, potentially using AI/ML model
inference, is done at Near-RT RIC. While AI/ML model training might be
hosted in Non-RT or Near-RT RIC, the description below is based on AI/ML

### 4.8.2 RF channel reconfiguration

#### 4.8.2.1 Background and goal of the use case

In mobile networks m-MIMO antennas are used for beamforming techniques
to enhance cell capacity and throughput. To achieve beamforming, O-RU(s)
need to concentrate the power amplifiers at the radome by combining
radiating elements. At low load, i.e., when the expected traffic volume
or number of connected users are lower than the configured threshold, ES
can be achieved by reducing the power consumption of O-RU(s) by
switching off certain Tx/Rx arrays. For example, 32 out of 64 Tx/Rx
arrays of an O-RU(s) can be switched off in a digital m-MIMO
architecture and correspondingly the number of spatial layers and SSBs
can be reduced. The procedure (involvement of respective O-RAN
interfaces) of the RF channel reconfiguration depends on the management
architecture model (hybrid or hierarchical) and the deployment option.
The switch off/on decision can be made by an AI/ML model within the
inference host deployed at the Non-RT RIC. Among others the AI/ML models
can include prediction of future traffic, user mobility, and resource
usage and can also predict expected energy efficiency enhancements,
resource usage, and network performance for different ES optimization
states.

This solution proposes a framework that allows the operator to flexibly
configure RF channel reconfiguration parameters in a cell or in a
cluster of cells through O1 configuration formulated by rApp towards E2
node(s) and O-RU(s) through SMO/Non-RT RIC or A1 policies formulated by
rApp towards Near-RT RIC through SMO/Non-RT RIC framework assisted by
Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

    reports (e.g., cell load related information and traffic
    information, EE/EC measurement reports) from E2 node(s), for the
    purpose of decision making, optionally using training and inference
    of AI/ML models that assist such EE/ES functions.

b)  Transfer collected data towards rApp. It is assumed that
    configurations, performance indicators and measurement reports
    collected from the O-DU contain the related information for the
    corresponding O-RU(s).

c)  Signal updated configurations for EE/ES optimization towards E2

    beams, modification of the O-RU antenna transmit power, modification
    of the number of SU/MU MIMO data layers or spatial streams) as part
    of EE/ES optimization.

    reconfiguration (i.e., O-RU Tx/Rx array selection, modification of
    the number of SSB beams, modification of the O-RU antenna transmit
    power, modification of the number of SU/MU MIMO spatial streams or
    data layers) as part of EE/ES optimization.

    traffic information, EE/EC measurement reports) from E2 nodes.

b)  (Optionally) Receive EE/ES AI/ML model for deployment via O1 or O2
    interface.

c)  Receive EE/ES related policies via A1 interface for consideration
    during optimization.

d)  Analyse the received data from E2 nodes and perform AI/ML model
    inference to determine EE/ES. Optimization (i.e., if carriers or
    cells are recommended to be switched off/on) considering the
    optimization targets/policies.

e)  Provide policies or required information to E2 node via E2 to
    trigger actions for EE/ES optimization.

##### 4.8.2.3.2 A1 policy based RF channel reconfiguration optimization for energy saving

In this solution, decision making, potentially using AI/ML model
inference, is done at Near-RT RIC. While AI/ML model training might be
hosted in Non-RT or Near-RT RIC, the description below is based on AI/ML
model inferencing in the Near-RT RIC.

The context of the A1 policy based optimization for energy saving is
captured in table 4.8.2.3.2-1.

### 4.8.3 Advanced sleep mode

This use case describes a method to achieve intelligent energy saving by
optimizing the sleep mode via Non-RT RIC-based guidance.

#### 4.8.3.1 Background and goal of the use case

Mobile networks were often designed to provide higher data rates, better
coverage, and ubiquitous connectivity. They have to be always available
and well-dimensioned in order to ensure the best Quality of Service
(QoS) even in peak hours and emergency or mass event scenarios. This may
lead to an over-dimensioned and under-utilized network particularly when
the traffic demand is low, such is the case during night hours.

The energy consumption of a network is composed of two components:

-   A fixed component, which is mainly due to the system architecture
    and includes the power consumption of control signals, backhaul
    infrastructure, and load-independent consumption of baseband
    processors.

-   A variable, load-dependent component, which depends on the
    transported traffic.

Over-provisioning of the network as well as low load periods translate
into significant, and unnecessary, energy consumption, due to the fixed
component. Sleep modes, which consist in shutting down the O-RU for a
certain period of time, are an efficient way to handle this component.

It consists in a progressive deactivation of the O-RU's components
according to the time needed by each of them to shut down then
reactivate again. According to this transition time, four levels of
sleep modes have been specified in CUS \[12\], clause 16. Deeper sleep
levels allow more energy saving but induce larger delays for the users
who arrive to the network and who need to wait longer for the components
to be reactivated. Hence, Non-RT RIC can provide policies in such cases
where reactivation time may not be concern or proactively reactivates.

O-RU and E2 nodes (O-CU, O-DU) may implement various sleep modes. The
sleep modes could be enabled by SMO/Non-RT RIC through A1 policy. When
enabled, the Near-RT RIC selects among the sleep modes considering their
capabilities, the actual traffic situation, and the network conditions.
Different SM operate at different time scales (e.g., symbol, slot,
frame).

This solution proposes a framework that allows the operator to flexibly
select various sleep modes parameters through A1 policy formulated by
rApp towards Near-RT RIC through SMO/Non-RT RIC framework assisted by
Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

hosted in Non-RT or Near-RT RIC, the description below is based on AI/ML
model inferencing in the Near-RT RIC.

### 4.8.4 Time domain cell DTX/DRX optimization (3GPP Rel-18)

#### 4.8.4.1 Background and goal of the use case

In 3GPP Release 18 \[21\], clause 15.4.2.3, Discontinuous Transmission
(DTX) and Discontinuous Reception (DRX) mechanisms were further enhanced
to improve energy efficiency for the gNB. To reduce the gNB\'s downlink
transmission and uplink reception active time, the UE can be configured
with a periodic cell DTX/DRX pattern, which defines active and
non-active periods. This pattern is common for UEs configured with this
feature in the cell, and the cell DTX/DRX patterns can be configured and
activated separately. A maximum of two cell DTX/DRX patterns can be
configured per MAC entity for different serving cells. When cell DTX is
activated, the UE may not monitor PDCCH in selected cases or does not
monitor SPS occasions during the non-active duration of the cell DTX.
Similarly, when cell DRX is activated, the UE does not transmit on CG
resources or transmit an SR during the non-active duration of the cell
DRX. This feature is applicable only to UEs in the RRC_CONNECTED state
and does not impact the Random Access procedure, SSB transmission,
paging, or system information broadcasting. Cell DTX/DRX can be
activated or deactivated via RRC signaling or L1 group common signaling.

Cell DTX/DRX is characterized by:

-   Active duration: The duration during which the UE is expected to
    receive PDCCHs, SPS occasions, and transmit SR or CG. In this
    duration, the gNB\'s transmission/reception of PDCCH, SPS, SR, CG,
    and periodic/semi-persistent CSI reports are not impacted for
    energy-saving purposes.

-   Cycle: Specifies the periodic repetition of the active duration
    followed by a non-active period.

The active duration and cycle parameters are common between cell DTX and
DRX when both are configured. If there is an emergency call or a public
safety-related service (e.g., MPS or MCS), the network ensures that
these services are not impacted, possibly by releasing or deactivating
the cell DTX/DRX configuration. The network should also ensure at least
partial overlap between the UE's connected mode DRX on-duration and cell
DTX/DRX active duration, ensuring that the UE's DRX periodicity is a
multiple of the cell DTX/DRX periodicity, or vice versa.

The Non-RT RIC considers several factors when generating A1 policies for
energy savings through cell DTX/DRX. These factors include real-time
traffic patterns, the density of Rel-18-capable UEs, and the potential
for energy savings in specific cells. It also evaluates QoE/QoS
requirements to ensure service quality is maintained. Based on this
analysis, the Non-RT RIC generates A1 policies that include, but are not
limited to, the following:

**Activate DTX/DRX** in cells with low traffic or a high concentration
of Rel-18 UEs.

**Steer Rel-18 UEs** toward specific cells, enabling those cells to
either operate efficiently or be shut down.

**Bar non-Rel-18 UEs** from cells optimized for DTX/DRX to maximize
energy savings.

**Balance QoE/QoS** by adjusting traffic steering and DTX/DRX settings,
ensuring energy efficiency without service

degradation.

These A1 policies are enforced by the Near-RT RIC, which dynamically
applies DTX/DRX configurations and traffic steering decisions in
near-real-time.

## 4.9 O-Cloud resource optimization

This clause contains the set of O-Cloud resource optimization use cases

### 4.9.1 Use case: O-Cloud node draining use case

This use case describes the procedure for the SMO/Non-RT RIC to perform
draining of specific O-Cloud node \[O-Cloud node description based on
O2-GA&P \[13\] recommendation by rApp through SMO, which can result in
relocation of network functions or its components to another O-Cloud
node, thereby restoring network function i.e., network healing.

#### 4.9.1.1 Background and goal of the use case

When one or more NF(s) is (are) experiencing some performance
degradation, and there is possibility that issue could not be fixed, or
root cause could not be identified just by analyzing O1 (FCAPS) data.
There can be a requirement of co-relating O1 and O2 (FCAPS) data
optionally with the help of AI/ML, which can result in identification of
root cause.

Examples for reasons to perform O-Cloud node draining:

-   There is possibility of faulty or misconfiguration of underneath
    > O-Cloud node. By co-relating RAN OAM and O2 related data rApp will
    > help in identifying issue in O-Cloud node which is found to be the
    > root cause of NF\'s performance degradation, then O-Cloud can be
    > drained, and relocation of the NF(s) on another O-Cloud node can
    > be performed. This example explains a scenario where an action can
    > be invoked when NF(s) performance degradation happens due to
    > O-Cloud node(s), which can be resolved by draining the O-Cloud
    > node.

> NOTE: The O-Cloud node(s) is set to maintenance mode (as specified in
> O2-GA&P \[13\], clause 3.10.2) by default, when this use case is
> called.

#### 4.9.1.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

1)  SMO/Non-RT RIC framework:

    -   To collect necessary performance, configuration, and other data
        for rApp to define and update policies which guides the SMO for
        O-Cloud resource management through O2 related functions over O2
        interface.

    -   Non-RT RIC framework should support rApp for managing data to
        and from O2 related functions related to resource management.

    -   Train AI/ML model with data from O1 and O2, which supports rApp
        > to predict possible requirement of O-Cloud node draining.

2)  rApps:

    -   Collect the necessary configurations, performance indicators,
        and measurement reports from SMO/Non-RT RIC framework.

    -   (Optionally) Retrain, update, configure AI/ML model.

    -   Infer an optimized policies/recommendations for O-Cloud node
        > draining based on the data collected using R1 interface.

3)  O2 related functions (NFO/FOCOM):

    -   To support discovery and delivery of O-Cloud IMS/DMS FCAPS data.

    -   To support reception of policy/recommendations from rApp and
        > enforcing these policies/ recommendations towards O-Cloud over
        > O2 interface.

4)  RAN OAM functions:

    -   Retrieve relevant PM, CM, FM data from E2 nodes via the O1
        interface.

    -   Allow rApps to access the PM, CM, FM data over R1 interface.

5)  O-Cloud (IMS and DMS):

    -   To support delivery of O-Cloud (IMS/DMS) resource performance,
        configuration, and other data to O2 related functions.

    -   To provide feedback post completion or non-completion of
        recommendations to Non-RT RIC through O2 related functions.

    -   To support to relocate network function and drain O-Cloud node.

6)  E2 nodes:

    -   Support to send fault and measurement data, RAN configurations
        to SMO/Non-RT RIC via the O1 interface.

#### 4.9.1.3 Solutions

In this solution, decision making, potentially using AI/ML model
inference, is done at rApp. While AI/ML model training might be hosted
in Non-RT RIC, the description below is based on AI/ML model training in
the Non-RT RIC.

The context of Non-RT RIC based O-Cloud node draining is captured in
table 4.9.1.3-1.

| Step 14 (O)                      | AI/ML models can be retrained    |
|                                  | either on Non-RT RIC framework   |

|                                  | then rApp selects AI/ML model    |
|                                  | and initiate retraining on       |
|                                  | Non-RT RIC framework.            |

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Step 15 (O)                      | Upon receiving retraining        |
|                                  | request from rApp. Non-RT RIC    |
|                                  | framework initiates AI/ML model  |

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Step 17 (O)                      | If AI/ML model retraining is     |
