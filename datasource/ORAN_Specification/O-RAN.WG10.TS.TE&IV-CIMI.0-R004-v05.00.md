Scope 
This document specifies the Information Model used to support TE&IV services within the SMO. The TE&IV Information 
Models described in this document are structured using the concept of Namespaces. In addition, relevant sections in this 
document include information imported from existing standards and industry work that serve as a basis for O-RAN TE&IV. 
The Annex section of this document describes multiple views of the TE&IV Information Models that supports TE&IV Service 
Consumer use cases [1] within the SMO. 
The TE&IV Information Models specified in this present document is part of a “modeling continuum” that aims to establish 
and evolve an O-RAN TE&IV Information Model from which O-RAN TE&IV Data Models may be generated manually or 
with a set of tools. However, the O-RAN TE&IV Data Models is out of scope of this present document and will be specified in 
a different specification.

TE&IV Information Models 
4.1 
Introduction 
The TE&IV Information Models described in this specification exposes the Topology Entities and Topology Relationships of 
the TE&IV resources as defined in [1]. 
4.2 
TE&IV Information Modeling Guidelines 
4.2.1 
Modeling approach, Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
The TE&IV Information Models shall use the Unified Modeling Language™ (UML®) version 2.5.1 [3] from the Object 
Management Group (OMG). 
UML provides a rich set of concepts, graphical notations, and model elements to model distributive systems. 3GPP TS 32.156 
[2] provides the necessary and sufficient set of UML notations and model elements, including the ones built by the UML 
extension mechanism <<stereotype>> to model network management systems and their managed nodes. These conventions are 
applied to the TE&IV Information Model. 
The TE&IV Information Model also defines UML notation, model elements and <<stereotypes>> which shall be used to 
model behaviours of the Topology Entity and Topology Relationship. 
The TE&IV Information Model uses embedded PlantUML for diagraming and the relationships are modeled using UML Class 
diagram conventions. 
O-RAN TE&IV Information Models shall also follow methodology documented in 3GPP TS 32.160 [4] Clause 5.2. 
4.2.1.1 
Model elements and notation 
4.2.1.1.1 
General 
The UML graphical notation in this document is only used to represent the Topology Entity and Topology Relationship model 
elements. 
UML properties as defined in [3] clause 9.5 are referred in this document and shall be used only for TE&IV Information 
Model. 
4.2.1.1.2 
Basic model elements  
UML [3] has defined a number of basic model elements. This subclause lists the subset selected for use in TE&IV Information 
Model. 
The characteristics defined in UML [3] clause 11.4 is applicable to TE&IV Information Model. However, in this specification, 
classes may or may not have attributes and the graphical notation of a class may show a suppressed attribute (middle) 
compartment even if the class has attributes, as shown in figure below. The operation (bottom) compartment is also 
suppressed.

Attribute 
4.2.1.1.3.1 
Description 
In UML [3], an attribute is a typed element of a class that is represented by a property. The properties listed in this section 
represents the attributes of a Topology Entity and Topology Relationship class.  
Table 4.2.1.1.3.1-1 below lists the adaptations of the attribute properties and its values applicable for TE&IV Information 
Model when re-using the attribute properties specified in 3GPP TS 32.156 [2] clause 5.2.1.

4.2.1.1.4 
Association Relationship 
4.2.1.1.4.1 
Description 
An association relationship class is a modelling construct that represents potentially complex series of associations that may 
cross domain boundaries. These classes are identifiable, searchable, have attributes and a record of the entities (and potentially 
configuration/associations) that make up their source. 
Association relationship classes are appropriate for use to show a relationship between different Topology Entities [see clause 
4.2.1.1.2] through the Topology Relationship class [see clause 4.2.1.1.3]. Each association relationship class has aSide and 
bSide relationships, multiplicity, and navigability as shown in the example clause 4.2.1.1.4.2.  
For a Topology Relationship, the following rules apply:  
1. The Topology Relationship class name shall have the form “<X>_{REL}_<Y>”, where <X> represents the TEC at 
the aSide of the relationship, <Y> represents the TEC at the bSide of the relationship, and {REL} is a transient verb 
representing the relationship between <X> and <Y>. e.g., NFDeployment_serves_ODUFunction.  
2. The aSide is considered the originating side of the relationship. The bSide is considered the terminating side of the 
relationship. The order of aSide and bSide is of importance and shall not be changed once defined.  
3. The Topology Relationship is a bi-directional relationship which indicates the navigability from either the aSide or 
bSide of the associated Topology Entity. 
4.2.1.1.4.2 Example 
For TE&IV Information model, the example (Figure 4.2.1.1.4.2-1) shows a bi-directional association. In this example, both 
Topology Entity classes (AbcFunction and XyzFunction) are related through a separate relationship class named 
Abc_REL_Xyz. By default, the aSide of the relationship is considered originating when relating its associated Topology Entity 
classes.

4.2.1.1.4.3 Name style 
The name shall use the same style as used in << TopologyRelationshipClass >> clause 4.2.1.2.3.3. 
4.2.1.1.5 
Abstract class 
4.2.1.1.5.1 
Description 
An abstract class is a generalized representation of Topology Entity and Topology Relationship classes. An abstract class 
cannot be instantiated. 
This modelled element has the same properties as class. See 4.2.1.1.2. 
4.2.1.1.5.2 
Example 
This example (Figure 4.2.1.1.5-1) shows that AbcFunction_ of stereotype TopologyEntityClass is an abstract class. It is a 
generalization of both AbcFunction1 and AbcFunction2.

The name shall use the same style as used in TopologyEntityClass and TopologyRelationshipClass as specified in clauses 
4.2.1.2.2.3 and 4.2.1.2.3.3. The name shall be in italics and its last character shall be an underscore. 
4.2.1.2 
Stereotype 
4.2.1.2.1 
Description 
Subclause 4.2.1 listed the UML defined basic model elements. UML defined a stereotype concept allowing the specification of 
simple or complex user-defined model elements. 
This subclause lists all allowable stereotypes for TE&IV Information Model.  
The names of stereotypes shall be chosen such that they do not clash with any stereotype defined in O-RAN. 
The characteristics defined in subclause 5.3.0 of 3GPP TS 32.156 [2] is applicable to TE&IV Information Model elements i.e, 
as per the clause 5.3.0 of 3GPP TS 32.156 [2] “For each stereotype model element listed, there are three parts. The first part 
contains its description. The second part contains its graphical notation examples, and the third part contains the rule, if any, 
recommended for labelling or naming it”.  
4.2.1.2.2 
<<TopologyEntityClass>> 
4.2.1.2.2.1 
Description 
The << TopologyEntityClass >> is identical to UML class [3] clause 11.4.3.1 which specifies a Topology Entity Resource 
including properties, attributes and allows inheritance but it does not include/define methods or operations.

4.2.2 
Modeling guidelines 
The TE&IV Information Models references concepts from each of the other O-RAN Information Model Namespaces by 
adding and removing attributes, entities, and relationships to serve the needs of the SMO use cases and services. TE&IV 
Information Models use multiple separate Namespaces to support independent lifecycle of loosely coupled topology and 
inventory concepts. 
The definitions and mapping involved with the TE&IV resources created within O-RAN TE&IV shall follow the below 
mentioned guidelines: 
• 
shall be defined in a TE&IV namespace 
• 
shall follow the 3GPP style when defining its identity and attributes [5] 
• 
shall maintain a standard mapping to existing O-RAN definitions within O-RAN namespaces  
• 
if it is a 1:1 mapping with other namespace resource, not limited to O-RAN, 
o 
the resource name shall be reused exactly 
o 
the identities used in the TE&IV resources shall encapsulate the type of the instance identifier and the instance 
identifier of the resource defined in other source namespaces 
 
• 
if it is a 1:N mapping with other namespace resource, not limited to O-RAN, 
o 
the resource name shall begin with O-RAN prefix “ORT-” 
o 
the identities used in the TE&IV resources shall be generated within TE&IV and represented using a TE&IV 
specified type of the instance identifier and the generated instance identifier of the resource 
o 
the generated identities to map the TE&IV instance identifier to the source shall be preserved along with the 
identity of the source.

TE&IV Service Operations 
4.4.1 
Introduction 
This clause provides the stage 2 definitions of TE&IV Service Operations for exposing Topology Entities, Topology 
Relationships and their attributes.  
The information model in Figure 4.4.1-1 depicts the model view of the entities used in the TE&IV Service Operations initiated 
by TE&IV Service Consumers to retrieve the Domains in Topology, Topology Entities and Topology Relationships. 
 
Figure 4.4.1-1: ORAN SMO TE&IV Topology Domain, Topology Entity and Topology Relationship Model 
View 
The Figure 4.4.1-2 shows the allowed inter-domain relationships. It depicts subclasses of the Domain concept comprising two 
distinct categories: Relationship and Entity. An Entity Domain may contain both Entities and Relationships, however both 
aSide and bSide of such relationships shall exist in that domain. A Relationship Domain encapsulates Relationships to Entities 
in one or more Entity Domains. The Relationship Domain should not have any Entities.

TE&IV User Defined Data  
4.5.1 
Introduction 
TE&IV user defined data is used for enriching Topology Entities and Topology Relationships. Such data can be added to existing 
Topology Entities and Relationships which enables flexibility for TE&IV Service Consumers in its usage of the service 
operations defined in clause 4.4. The user defined data are declared in separate schemas and are added through a REST API 
which shall be defined in the TE&IV API [17].  The following clauses provide the definitions for the types of TE&IV user 
defined data. 
4.5.2 
Classifiers  
Classifiers permit the association of a well defined user specified string with a Topology Entity and/or Topology Relationship. 
Classifiers are declared in a schema added through a REST API [17]. When the schema is successfully created and validated, 
the user can assign the classifiers to the selected entities and/or relationships.  
4.5.2.1 
Definitions 
This class provides the representation of Classifiers.
