# 4 O-RAN SMO Architecture

## 4.1 SMO Overview

The SMO capabilities identified as SMOSs are represented in a
service-based architecture in Figure 4.1-1 below. All the SMO Service
producers represented in Figure 4.1-1 can also be SMOS consumers.

Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) and Service Management and
Orchestration framework (SMO framework) are used interchangeably in this
document.

NOTE: The SMOS interfaces and modelling are not specified in the present
document.

Figure 4.1-1: SMO capabilities represented as SMOSs in the SMO SBA
approach

> NOTE: The AI/ML Workflow, RAN Analytics and Policy Management and
> Information SMOSs shown in Figure 4.1-1 are not addressed in the
> current version of this specification.

The SMOS Communication, shown in Figure 4.1-1, represents the logical
support for communication between any SMOS Producer, SMOS Consumer, and
rApps. Examples of SMOS Communication implementation include, but are
not limited to, service mesh, API gateway, direct communication, and
message bus. SMOS consumers and producers rely on the capabilities
provided by SME for purposes such as service discovery and on the
capabilities provided by DME for purposes such as data exposure.

The R1 interface, shown in Figure 4.1-1, is a service-based interface.
R1 termination, also shown in Figure 4.1-1, enables R1 service producers
and R1 service consumers to exchange messages via the R1 interface.

SME and DME support the exposure of SMO services, and/or data to
authorized external services, and/or external data consumers, as
represented in the SBA approach depicted in Figure 4.1-1.

SME and DME support the SMO consumption of external services, and/or
data from authorized external services, and/or external data producers,
as represented in the SBA approach depicted in Figure 4.1-1.

## 4.2 SMO Services (SMOS)

### 4.2.1 Introduction to SMO Services

Editor's Note: overview of the SMO capabilities.

### 4.2.2 Service Management and Exposure (SME) SMOS description

The SME service is introduced in the Non-RT RIC Architecture
specification \[i.1\] section 3.1. The SME services are applicable to
any entities within the SMO that fulfil the roles of Service Producer
and/or Service Consumer.

In a service-based SMO architecture, the SME can be leveraged as a
generic SMOS, handling service management and exposure for any SMOSs
within SMO. The SME SMOS provides a set of common SMO capabilities that
are needed for all SMO Services.

The SME SMOS offers the following capabilities:

-   Service registration,

-   Service discovery,

-   Authentication and authorization to access a service,

-   Communication support (e.g. service mesh) between Service Producers
    and Service Consumers,

-   Bootstrap of new Service consumers and Service Producers
    (determination of the endpoints for the SME services) (optional),

-   Heartbeat of Service producers (optional).

The role of one, or both, of Service Producer and Service Consumer can
be assumed by any SMOF or rApp in the SMO. The services are registered
individually. The Service Consumers can also be external to the SMO, for
the services made discoverable and exposed also to the external SMO
consumers.

### 4.2.3 Data Management and Exposure (DME) SMOS description

The DME SMOS provides capabilities that allow Data Consumers, as defined
in the Non-RT RIC Architecture specification \[i.1\], to discover data
types and to consume collected data, and allow Data Producers, as
defined in the Non-RT RIC Architecture specification \[i.1\], to
register data types and to produce data for collection. The DME services
can handle any registered data types and expose them for discovery and
consumption to Data Consumers. In the Non-RT RIC Architecture
specification \[i.1\] clause 3.2, both the Data Producer and Data
Consumer are restricted to refer only to rApps, because the scope of
\[i.1\] is the R1 interface between rApps and the SMO/Non-RT RIC
framework.

This is extended in a decoupled service-based SMO architecture, where
the DME SMOS can be leveraged as an enabler handling any SMOS data
types, therefore any SMOF can also be a Data Producer and/or a Data
Consumer which can benefit from using DME SMOS to register, produce,
discover and consume data.

The role of one, or both, of Data Producer and Data Consumer can be
assumed by any SMOF and rApp (for the data types related to each SMOS
and/or rApp) in the SMO. The SMO Data Consumers can also be external SMO
consumers, for the data made discoverable and allowed to be exposed to
the external SMO consumers.

### 4.2.4 RAN NF OAM SMOS description

The RAN NF OAM SMOS includes, but is not limited to, the following set
of capabilities: 

-   Provisioning Management, including bulk and basic synchronous and
    asynchronous configuration management CRUD (create, read, update,
    delete) operations, CM notifications and model exposure.

-   Fault Supervision Management, including alarm subscription,
    notification, clearing, acknowledgement, and query

-   Performance Management, including PM counter initiation and
    supervision

-   Trace Management, including trace initiation and supervision

-   Streaming Data Reporting, including stream collection and stream
    exposure. 

-   File Data Reporting, including file collection and file exposure. 

-   PNF software and hardware management.  

-   NF Log data collection and exposure.

RAN NF OAM capabilities are exposed to consumers via SME and DME.

The RAN NF OAM capabilities also provide mechanisms to allow their
service consumers to scope the target of their requests (e.g., to entire
RAN, to specific areas, NFs, cells, etc.), allowing the request to be
applied to either a single target or multiple targets at once.

### 4.2.5 Network Function Orchestrator SMOS description

The Network Function Orchestrator (NFO) SMOS includes capabilities for
the orchestration of the NF Deployments that constitute the Cloudified
NFs. This includes the initial deployment of the software and any
subsequent lifecycle management actions necessary on the respective NF
Deployments instances, such as healing, updates, scaling, software
upgrades, termination, etc.

The NFO SMOS leverages the NF Deployment management services provided by
the O-Clouds, each exposing O2dms services over the O2 interface, for
deployment and lifecycle management of NF Deployment instances.

The NFO SMOS interacts with the DMS by means of specified O2dms
profiles:

-   The ETSI NFV O2dms profile \[5\], which is based on the ETSI GS-NFV
    SOL 003 protocol specification \[11\]

-   The Kubernetes O2dms profile \[6\], which is based on the Kubernetes
    API protocol specification

The NFO SMOS also provide capabilities for:

-   Monitoring the execution status of lifecycle operations/requests
    that the NFO has been requested to execute

-   Querying to understand which O-Cloud node cluster an NF Deployment
    is deployed on

-   Secure handling of sensitive NF Deployment configuration data

NFO SMOS capabilities are exposed to consumers via SME and DME.

NOTE: The capability of the NFO is introduced from a logical perspective
in the O-RAN Working Group 6 O2 Interface General Aspects and Principles
specification \[2\] and the use cases are described in the O-RAN WG6
Cloudification and Orchestration Use Cases and Requirements
specification \[3\].

### 4.2.6 Federated O-Cloud Orchestration and Management (FOCOM) SMOS description

The Federated O-Cloud Orchestration and Management (FOCOM) SMOS includes
capabilities for orchestration of cluster and infrastructure resources
in one or several O-Clouds. It includes, but is not limited to, the
following capabilities:

-   Querying and discovery of O-Cloud infrastructure inventory
    information such as O-Cloud Sites, physical and logical
    infrastructure resources, Node Clusters, Deployment Managers and
    O-Cloud Template information.

-   Subscription for notifications related to changes in O-Cloud
    infrastructure inventory information.

-   Provisioning (create, update, delete) of cluster and infrastructure
    resources in each O-Cloud.

-   Monitoring of cluster and infrastructure resources in each O-Cloud.

The FOCOM SMOS exposes O-Cloud infrastructure inventory information that
is acquired from the O-Cloud O2ims inventory service. The FOCOM SMOS
enables the service consumer to subscribe for notifications related to
particular O-Cloud resource types.

FOCOM SMOS capabilities are exposed to consumers via SME and DME.

NOTE: The functionality of FOCOM is introduced from a logical
perspective in the O-RAN Working Group 6 O2 Interface General Aspects
and Principles specification \[2\] and the use cases are described in
the O-RAN WG6 Cloudification and Orchestration Use Cases and
Requirements specification \[3\].

### 4.2.7 Service and Slice Subnet Orchestration SMOS (SO SMOS) description

The SO SMOS includes capabilities to perform the orchestration of a RAN
service and/or slice subnet. This includes both the orchestration of the
fulfilment of the RAN service or the RAN slice subnet, and orchestration
support for the actuation of an assurance process. The behaviour of the
SO SMOS is dependent on both the SO requests that it receives and the
related artifacts to support the requests. The exact definition of the
RAN service is defined by the operator using the SMO, it can be
generally considered as a logical concept that represents the capability
for the RAN within a certain geographic area, to provide UEs the ability
to have voice and/or data connectivity to the core, with requested
characteristics. This includes the RAN slice subnet. In order to execute
on its responsibilities, the SO SMOS consumes other services including
the RAN NF OAM SMOS for configuration, the FOCOM SMOS for infrastructure
management requests, the NFO for deployment requests, as well as
services produced by rApps, etc.

The SO SMOS includes the following capabilities:

-   Oversees and automates the fulfillment of a service or a slice
    subnet order, received directly or via a higher -level orchestrator,
    according to the information contained in the service or a slice
    subnet order and the related artifacts, utilizing the services
    provided by SMOFs (such as SMOFs supporting RAN NF OAM SMOS for
    configuration, NFO SMOS for NF Deployment \[2\] LCM, etc.) and
    services produced by rApps.

-   Coordinates the orchestration of lifecycle and service or the slice
    subnet-related configuration for one or more RAN NFs (also including
    multiple NF Deployments), including taking the homing decision
    considering both the RAN service or the slice subnet, and
    application-level requirements as well as the non-functional
    requirements e.g., infrastructure capabilities needed as well as the
    transport networks used to interconnect the O-RAN NFs (and NF
    Deployments) and O-RUs when they are deployed over different sites
    in order to meet the connectivity requirements for the RAN service
    or the slice subnet. This can include generating the required
    configuration used when requesting (via the appropriate SMOS) the
    configuration of the RAN NFs.

-   Coordination of the NFs transport connectivity: based on
    requirements and objectives obtained on RAN NF connectivity it
    requests the suitable transport networks management domain to fulfil
    the requirements of the RAN service and/or slice subnet
    requirements.

-   Based on the infrastructure requirements of the O-RAN NF
    Deployments, it orchestrates the necessary management actions to the
    O-Cloud infrastructure, by coordinating with FOCOM SMOS producer for
    the needed O-Cloud management requests.

SO SMOS capabilities are exposed to consumers via SME and DME.

### 4.2.8 Service and Slice Subnet Assurance SMOS (SA SMOS) description

The SA SMOS includes capabilities to ensure the required assurance for
the RAN services and slice subnets. The behaviour of SA SMOS is
dependent upon the related artifacts to support the request. It consumes
the services provided by other SMOS Producers and can delegate
responsibilities to rApps according to its configuration.

The SA SMOS includes the following capabilities:

-   Assures the intended state (together with rApps and/or other SMOSs)
    of the RAN services and slice subnets.

-   It monitors/observes the data that is relevant (produced by other
    SMOS producers and/or services produced by rApps) to assessing the
    current RAN service, and/or RAN slice subnet characteristics against
    the service requirements.

-   In case the RAN service and/or RAN slice subnet requirements are not
    met, decisions are taken (together with rApps and/or other SMOSs) on
    a course of remedial actions.

-   The identified actions (e.g., configuration changes, scaling,
    changes of connectivity, etc.) are executed (by making requests to
    rApps and/or other SMOSs producers), as part of an open or closed
    automation loop.

-   In the case that the service or slice subnet requirements cannot be
    met, the service assurance will escalate to the operator and/or
    northbound systems.

SA SMOS capabilities are exposed to consumers via SME and DME.

### 4.2.9 rApp Management SMOS description

The rApp management SMOS includes the following set of capabilities:

-   rApp lifecycle management, including rApp deployment, rApp upgrade
    and rApp termination.

-   rApp configuration management, which enables management of the rApp
    instance configuration settings.

-   rApp fault management, which enables an rApp instance to report
    faults that are related to the rApp itself or to its communication
    with other entities.

-   rApp performance management, which enables an rApp instance to
    report on the performance of the rApp itself or to its communication
    with other entities.

-   rApp logging, which enables an rApp instance to generate and report
    timestamped logs, including audit trail records of its configuration
    actions within the network.

rApp management SMOS capabilities are exposed to consumers via SME and
DME.

NOTE 1: An rApp instance is a specific occurrence of an rApp as defined
in \[1\].

NOTE 2: rApp package on-boarding is a prerequisite for executing the
capabilities of the rApp management SMOS. The rApp package on-boarding
is not in scope of this SMOS.

For further details see O-RAN TS: Non-RT RIC Architecture \[4\].

### 4.2.10 Topology Exposure and Inventory SMOS description

The Topology Exposure and Inventory (TE&IV) SMOS includes, but is not
limited to, the following capabilities:

-   Creating, updating and deleting information about TE&IV resources
    and the relationships between them

-   Querying to obtain information about the TE&IV resources and the
    relationships between them, using filter criteria such as TE&IV
    resource types and/or geo-location data

-   Subscribing for notifications of changes to TE&IV resource
    information

TE&IV resources include both RAN resources and O-Cloud resources. For
further details see O-RAN TS: O-RAN Topology Exposure and Inventory
Management Services Use Cases and Requirements \[7\].

Topology Exposure and Inventory SMOS capabilities are exposed to
consumers via SME and DME.

### 4.2.11 Software Package Onboarding SMOS description

The Software Package Onboarding SMOS includes, but is not limited to,
the following capabilities:

-   Onboarding of software packages to the SMO

-   Validation of software packages to ensure that their format and
    contents can be understood by the SMO

-   Security verification of the software package contents

-   Extraction of artifacts contained in the software package and making
    them available to other SMOSs for consumption

-   Deletion of software packages from the SMO

-   Querying the list of onboarded software packages

Software packages supported by the Software Package Onboarding SMOS
include O-RAN NFs (as defined in the O-RAN Operations and Maintenance
Architecture \[8\]), rApps and xApps.

Software Package Onboarding SMOS capabilities are exposed to consumers
via SME and DME.

For further details see O-RAN TS: O-RAN Onboarding SMOS General Aspects
and Principles \[9\].

### 4.2.12 A1 Related SMOS description

The A1 Related SMOS includes, but is not limited to, the following
capabilities:

-   Support for management of A1 policies, including discovery of A1
    policies and A1 policy types available in Near-RT RICs, as well as
    creation, querying, updating, and deletion of A1 policies, querying
    the enforcement status of A1 policies, and subscribing for event
    notifications related to A1 policies and A1 policy types.

-   Support for A1 Enrichment Information (EI), including registration
    and deregistration of EI types.

-   Support for discovering AI/ML model training capabilities exposed by
