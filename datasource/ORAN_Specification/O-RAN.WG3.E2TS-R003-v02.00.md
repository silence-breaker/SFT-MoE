    2.  ## Conformance testing Near-RT RIC

        1.  ### General

        2.  ### Test configuration

The test configuration for E2 conformance testing of Near-RT RIC is
illustrated in Figure 4.2.2‑1 which shows a test setup that employs an
E2 Node simulator, O-RU simulator, and UE simulator as a simplification.
A test set-up without use of simulations would require inclusion of an
O-RU with associated M-Plane support and also a real UE or test UE.

In as much as the conformance testing involves configuring the E2 Nodes
and the Near- RT RIC, it shall be performed by means of the O1
interface. Configuration of the E2 Nodes and Near-RT RIC to operate in
nominal state via the O1 interface and configuring for policy guidance
and enrichment data to the Near-RT RIC via the A1 interface are outside

the scope of this test specification.

Figure ‑ Illustration of Near-RT RIC E2 conformance test setup

Although the above test configuration diagrams illustrated Near-RT RIC,
O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU as separate entities, the E2 Node simulator may
support a range of different RAN configurations similar to the list of
cases described in "O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description" \[8\],
Annex A.4. Examples include:

\- Standalone O-CU-CP connected to one or more standalone O-CU-UP and
one or more standalone O-DU. Each logical node is considered as an E2
Node that presents an E2 interface to the Near-RT RIC.

\- Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP connected to one or more standalone
O-DU. The combined O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP may present either a common E2
interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual
O-RAN components

\- Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU. The combined node may present
either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding
to the individual O-RAN components

In all cases the different RAN components may initiate either
independent E2 connections to the Near-RT RIC for each logical O-RAN
component or may present a shared E2 interface and hence present the
combined RAN components as a common E2 Node supporting services
appropriate to more than one logical O-RAN components.The following RAN
configurations where the Near-RT RIC are bundled with some or all of the
O-RAN nodes as discussed in "O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description"
\[8\], Annex A.4, are not addressed in this version of the
specification.

-   Bundle the Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP

-   Bundle the Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU

    1.  #### Device Under Test (Near-RT RIC)

For enabling conformance testing, the Near-RT RIC has implemented the E2
interface, and the procedures specified in "O-RAN WG3: E2 Application
Protocol" \[2\] that are required to perform testing of the applicable
test cases. It may also support all or a subset of the E2 service models
- E2SM-KPM, E2SM-NI and E2SM-RC as specified in "ORAN WG3: E2SM KPM"
\[5\], "ORAN WG3: E2SM NI" \[4\] and "ORAN WG3: E2SM RC" \[6\]
respectively.

The DUT, Near-RT RIC, may comply to only a subset of E2 procedures and
E2 service models. Therefore, only those testcases that relate to
compliance claimed by a DUT are relevant. This is noted on a
case-by-case basis in testcases defined in clause 5.2.

#### Testing Tools

The E2 Node simulator simulates the E2 functionalities of the E2 Node
side and have flexibility to generate, receive and validate messages for
all the E2 global procedures and certain or all of the E2 service
models. The test simulator logs all message content during the testing.

The test simulator has all the capabilities needed to operate the E2
test cases, including:

-   Generate E2 Node initiated procedures.

-   Receive Near-RT RIC initiated procedures.

-   Generate responses for either successful or unsuccessful operations
    with appropriate cause value in case of failure.

The test simulator should support all the RAN configurations discussed
in clause 4.2.2, except those excluded in this version of the
specification as described above.

The E2 Node simulator may also logically simulate the UE functions from
the Near-RT RIC point of view, enabling meaningful cell and UE specific
E2 services to run. Only the UE functions sufficient to facilitate the
E2 interface focused conformance testing are simulated.

## Conformance testing E2 Nodes

### General

### Test configuration

The test configuration for E2 conformance testing of different types of
E2 Nodes are illustrated in Figure 4.3.2‑1. The test setup employs a
Near-RT RIC simulator, O-RU simulator, Core simulator and UE simulator
as a simplification. A test set-up without use of simulations would
require inclusion of real equipment. Configuring E2 Nodes to bring it to
nominal operating state via the O1 is outside the scope of this test
specification.

Figure ‑ Illustration of E2-Node conformance test setup

Although the above test configuration diagrams illustrate O-CU-CP,
O-CU-UP, O-DU as separate entities, the E2 Node may support a range of
different RAN configurations similar to the list of cases described in
"O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description" \[8\], Annex A.4. Examples
include:

\- Standalone O-CU-CP connected to one or more standalone O-CU-UP and
one or more standalone O-DU. Each logical node is considered as an E2
Node that presents an E2 interface to the Near-RT RIC.

\- Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP connected to one or more standalone
O-DU. The combined O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP may present either a common E2
interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual
O-RAN components

\- Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU. The combined node may present
either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding
to the individual O-RAN components

In all cases the different RAN components may initiate either
independent E2 connections to the Near-RT RIC Simulator for each logical
O-RAN component or may present a shared E2 interface and hence present
the combined RAN components as a common E2 Node supporting services
appropriate to more than one logical O-RAN component.

The following RAN configurations where the Near-RT RIC is bundled with
some or all of the O-RAN nodes as discussed in
"O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description" \[8\], Annex A.4, are not
addressed in this version of the specification.

#### Device Under Test (E2 Node)

The DUT could be of any E2 Node of the following type

-   O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP or O-DU

-   Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU

-   Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP

-   O-DU

-   O-eNB

For conformance testing the E2 Node has E2AP interface and implements
procedures specified in "O-RAN WG3: E2 Application Protocol" \[2\] that
are required to perform testing of the applicable test cases. It may
support all or a subset of the E2 service models - E2SM-KPM, E2SM-NI and
E2SM-RC as specified in "ORAN WG3: E2SM KPM" \[5\], "ORAN WG3: E2SM NI"
\[4\] and "ORAN WG3: E2SM RC" \[6\] respectively.

The DUT (E2 Node ) may comply to only a subset of E2AP procedures and E2
service models. Therefore, only those testcases that relate to
compliance claimed by a DUT are relevant. This is noted on a
case-by-case basis in testcases defined in clause 6.2.

#### Testing Tools

The Near-RT RIC simulator simulates the E2 functionalities of Near-RT
RIC and has flexibility to generate, receive and validate messages for
all the E2AP procedures and certain or all of the E2 service models. The
test simulator logs all message contents during the testing.

The test simulator has all the capabilities needed to operate the E2
test cases, including:

-   Generate Near-RT RIC initiated procedures.

-   Receive E2 Node initiated procedures.

-   Generate responses for either successful or unsuccessful operations
    with appropriate cause value in case of failure.

The Test simulator (Near-RT RIC) should support all the RAN
configurations discussed in clause 4.3.2, except those excluded in this
version of the specification as described above.

The test setup has the DUT (E2 Node) connect to other test equipment.
These can be real or simulated UEs, RAN elements and Core (EPC or 5GC)
to support scenarios appropriate for the E2 functionality being tested.
An SMO with O1 interface is also included optionally if the E2 Node or
any of real or simulated elements need configuration or operation to
function.

2.  ## Interoperability Testing between Near-RT RIC and E2 Node

    1.  ### General

FFS

### Test configuration

The test configuration for interoperability testing between Near-RT RIC
and E2 Node(s) is illustrated in figure 4.4.2-1 which shows a test setup
that employs a Non-RT RIC simulator, Core Simulator, O-RU simulator, and
UE simulator as a simplification. A test set-up without use of
simulations would require inclusion of a real O-RU with associated
M-Plane support and also a real UE or test UE.

In as much as the interoperability testing involves configuring the
Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node, it shall be performed by means of the O1
interface. Configuration of the Near-RT RIC and E2 Node to operate in
nominal state via the O1 interface, and configuring for policy guidance
and enrichment data to the Near-RT RIC via the A1 interface are outside
the scope of this test specification.

**Figure 4.4.2-1 Illustration of interoperability between Near-RT RIC
and E2 Node test setup**

Although the above test configuration diagrams illustrate O-CU-CP,
O-CU-UP, O-DU as separate entities, the E2 Node may support a range of
different RAN configurations similar to the list of cases described in
"O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description" \[8\], Annex A.4. Examples
include:

\- Standalone O-CU-CP connected to one or more standalone O-CU-UP and
one or more standalone O-DU. Each logical node is considered as an E2
Node that presents an E2 interface to the Near-RT RIC.

\- Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP connected to one or more standalone
O-DU. The combined O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP may present either a common E2
interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual
O-RAN components

\- Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU. The combined node may present
either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding
to the individual O-RAN components

In all cases the different RAN components may initiate either
independent E2 connections to the Near-RT RIC for each logical O-RAN
component or may present a shared E2 interface and hence present the
combined RAN components as a common E2 Node supporting services
appropriate to more than one logical O-RAN component.

The following RAN configurations where the Near-RT RIC is bundled with
some or all of the O-RAN nodes as discussed in
"O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description" \[8\], Annex A.4, are not
addressed in this version of the specification.

    2.  

#### System Under Test (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node)

The System Under Test (SUT) consist of Near-RT RIC and E2 Node.\
The E2 Node can be of any of the following type:

-   O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP or O-DU

-   Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU

-   Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP

-   O-DU

-   O-eNB

For enabling interoperability testing, the Near-RT RIC and E2 Node have
implemented the E2 interface, and the procedures specified in "O-RAN
WG3: E2 Application Protocol" \[2\] that are required to perform testing
of the applicable test cases. They may also support all or a subset of
the E2 service models - E2SM-KPM, E2SM-NI and E2SM-RC as specified in
"ORAN WG3: E2SM KPM" \[5\], "ORAN WG3: E2SM NI" \[4\], "ORAN WG3: E2SM
RC" \[6\] and "ORAN WG3: E2SM CCC" \[10\] respectively.

Each element of the SUT, Near-RT RIC and E2 Node, may comply to only a
subset of E2 procedures and E2 service models. Therefore, only those
testcases that relate to procedures supported by both Near-RT and E2
Node are relevant. This is noted on a case-by-case basis in testcases
defined in clause 7.

#### Testing Tools 

The test setup has the SUT (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node) connected to other
test equipments. These can be real or simulated UEs, O-RU, RAN elements,
Core (EPC or 5GC) and Non-RT RIC to support scenarios appropriate for
the E2 functionality being tested. An SMO with O1 interface is also
included optionally if the Near-RT RIC, E2 Node or any of real or
simulated elements need configuration or operation to function.

In addition, a TAP interface can be used on E2 interface between Near-RT
RIC and E2 Node to passively capture and analyze packets for test case
validation. Alternatively, E2 logs from the SUT can be used for protocol
analysis.

####### Expected results

The test is considered passed if

1)  Validation in test procedure steps 3 is successful.

2)  E2 logs recorded in the Test Simulator (E2 Node) are aligned with
    the message flow specified in \[2\] figure 8.3.4.2-1.

    1.  ##### RIC Service Update procedure with RAN Function deleted (positive case)

        1.  ###### Test Purpose

The purpose of this test case is to test the RIC Service Update
procedure of the DUT (Near-RT RIC) as specified in "O-RAN WG3: E2
Application Protocol" \[2\] clause 8.3.4. This test is designed to be
agnostic to the E2 Service Model and RAN functions supported by the
Near-RT RIC. This test covers the scenario where a RAN Function is
deleted as part of the RIC Service Update procedure. The expected
outcome is successful validation of the RIC SERVICE UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE
message from Near-RT RIC.

This testcase is conditional mandatory if DUT claims support of RIC
Service Update procedure.

###### Test Entrance Criteria

1)  The DUT (Near-RT RIC) and Test Simulator (E2 Node) support RIC
    Service Update procedure.

2)  The Test Simulator (E2 Node) has the functionality to initiate RIC
    Service Update procedure.

    1.  ###### Test Methodology

        1.  ####### Initial conditions

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1)  An SCTP association is successfully established between the two SCTP
    endpoints of the E2 interface.

2)  The DUT (Near-RT RIC) has already successfully completed E2 Setup
    procedure initiated from the Test Simulator (E2 Node) with a RAN
    function supported by the Test Simulator

    1.  ####### Procedure

            1.  ###### Test Purpose

The purpose of this test case is to test the RIC Control procedure of
Near-RT RIC as specified in \[2\] clause 8.2.4. This test is designed to
be agnostic to the E2 Service Model and RAN functions. The RAN Function
and RAN Function definition to which RIC Subscribes are predefined
between the DUT (Near-RT RIC) and the Test Simulator (E2 Node). The
expected outcome of this test is successful RIC Control procedure from
Near-RT RIC to the E2 Node.

Test cases for RIC Control procedures for specific E2 Service Models and
functionalities are defined in sections dedicated for Service Models.
These will reuse initial conditions, test procedures, and validation
steps specified in this section for base E2AP functionality.

        1.  ##### RIC Indication procedure with REPORT Service style 1 (positive)

            1.  ###### Test Purpose

The purpose of this test case is to test the RIC Indication procedure of
Near-RT RIC for RAN function "O-RAN-E2SM-KPM" REPORT Service style 1 as
specified in \[5\] clause 7.4.2. The expected outcome of this test is
successful receiving of the RIC INDICATION message associated with the
E2SM-KPM REPORT Service style 1 from the E2 Node.

This testcase is conditionally mandatory if the DUT (Near-RT RIC) claims
to support RIC Indication procedure for RAN function "O-RAN-E2SM-KPM"
REPORT Service style 1.

###### Test Entrance Criteria

> The test entrance criteria specified in clause 5.2.2.1.1.2 applies
> with agreed RAN Function Definition IE defined in \[5\] clause 8.2.2.1
> as per configuration profile shown in Table 5.2.3.1.1-1Table 5.2.2‑1

3.  ###### Test Methodology

    1.  ####### Initial conditions

The initial conditions specified in clause 5.2.2.1.1.3.1 applies. In
addition, at least one successful subscription associated with E2SM-KPM
REPORT Service style 1 exists. The RIC Event Trigger Definition and RIC
Action Definition IEs in the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message are
defined in Table 5.2.3.1.1-2

2.  ####### Procedure

    Step 1. Test Simulator periodically sends RIC INIDACTION message
    associated with the subscribed REPORT Service to the DUT (Near-RT
    RIC) according to the reporting period defined in the RIC Event
    Trigger Definition. The parameters used in the RIC Indication Header
    (Format 1) and RIC Indication Message (Format 1) are shown in Table
    5.2.3.2.1-1 and Table 5.2.3.2.1-2 respectively. The sent and
    received E2 messages are recorded.

    1.  ## General

        1.  ### Protocol Analyzer and TAP Interface

A TAP interface and a protocol analyzer may be used over the E2
interface to passively capture and analyze packets for test case
validation. Alternatively, packet capture capabilities of the SUT may be
used to capture packets for analysis to validate the test cases.
Captured pactets with associated analysis should be attached to the test
report.\
When the following test cases refer to the protocol analyzer and the TAP
interface, alternative E2 interface packet capture utilised as long as
decoding and analysis have been performed and are available in the test
report.

2.  ## Interoperability Test Cases

    1.  ### Test Cases for E2AP Global Procedures

        1.  #### Near-RT RIC Support procedures

            1.  ##### Test Purpose

RIC and E2 Node in the E2 interface management and Near-RT RIC support
functions as specified in "O-RAN WG3: E2 General Aspects and Principles"
\[1\] clause 5.5 and "O-RAN WG3: E2 Application Protocol" \[2\] clause
8.3.\
The expected outcome is successful establishment and management of the
E2 interface in the SUT.

claims to support E2AP global procedures with the exception of any test
steps marked as optional.

##### Test Entrance Criteria

1)  Each element of the SUT (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node) supports E2AP
    global procedures

2)  (Optional) the Near-RT RIC element of the SUT has the ability to
    trigger a RIC SERVICE QUERY message (the optional steps 3 can be
    performed).

3)  (Optional) one element of the SUT (Near-RT RIC or E2 Node) has the
    ability to trigger E2 Removal procedure, (the optional step 8 can be
    performed).

        1.  ###### Initial conditions

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

    information and E2 node configuration.

4)  The status of the SCTP association and E2 setup procedure is in one
    of the following conditions\
    condition A: SCTP association has not yet been established. Then E2
    Node shall initiate the SCTP procedure during step 2 below.\
    condition B: SCTP association has been established and configuration
    of the E2 Node is such that E2 Node is not yet sending any E2 SETUP
    REQUEST message towards Near-RT RIC.\
    condition C: SCTP association has been established and E2 Node is
    sending E2 SETUP REQUEST messages to Near-RT RIC but configuration
    in Near-RT RIC is such that no E2 SETUP RESPONSE is sent back.

    1.  ###### Procedure

> Step 1. Enable the protocoal analyzer to capture, record and decode
> the E2 signalling between SUT elements via the TAP interface.
>
> Step 2. Depending on the initial condition 4), enable the E2 interface
> towards the associated element either in Near-RT RIC or in E2 Node, by
> configuration or by establishment of the physical connection.

to the Near-RT RIC

Near-RT RIC sends E2 SETUP RESPONSE to E2 Node with the list of accepted
and rejected RAN Functions

> Step 3. (Optional) If the Near-RT RIC has the ability to trigger RIC
> SERVICE QUERY message towards the E2 Node, initiate appropriate action
> to trigger the procedure.
>
> After reception of RIC SERVICE QUERY message, E2 Node sends RIC
> SERVICE UPDATE message to the Near-RT RIC. E2 Node may send RIC
> SERVICE UPDATE message without any IE except for *Message Type* IE as
> specified in \[2\] clause 8.3.4.2.
>
> Near-RT RIC sends RIC SERVICE UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the E2
> Node.
>
> Step 4. Take appropriate action to initiate on E2 Node one of the
> following RIC service configuration changes:\
> - Adding a new RAN Function\
> - Modifying an existing RAN Function\
> - Deleting an existing RAN Function
>
> Step 5. E2 Node initiates RIC Service Update procedure by sending RIC
> SERVICE UPDATE message to the Near-RT RIC with the configuration
> change performed in Step 4.
>
> Near-RT RIC sends RIC SERVICE UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the E2
> Node.
>
> Step 6. Take appropriate action to initiate on the E2 Node one of the
> following E2 Node system configuration changes\
> - Adding a new E2 Node Component Configuration\
> - Updating an existing E2 Node Component Configuration\
> - Removing an existing E2 Node Component Configuration
>
> Step 7. E2 Node triggers E2 Node Configuration Update procedure by
> sending E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the Near-RT RIC.
>
> Near-RT RIC sends E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to
> the E2 Node.
>
> Step 8 (Optional) If one element of the SUT (Near-RT RIC or E2 Node)
> has the ability to trigger E2 Removal procedure, then initiate
> appropriate action to trigger the procedure.\
> - The element of the SUT (Near-RT RIC or E2 Node) initiating the E2
> Removal procedure sends E2 REMOVAL REQUEST message.\
> - The other element sends E2 REMOVAL RESPONSE message to initiating
> element.\
> - The initiating element initiates the removal of the TNL
> associations.

    1.  ####### Initial conditions

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1)  The elements of the SUT (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node) are connected by
    E2 interface

2)  E2 Setup procedure is successfully completed in the SUT with the
    agreed RAN Function Definition IE

    1.  ####### Procedure

> Step 1. Enable the protocol analyzer to capture, record and decode the
> E2 signalling between SUT elements via the TAP interface
>
> Step 2. Initiate in the Test Equipment the traffic required for the
> agreed measurement

Step 3. Perform RIC Subscription Request from the Near-RT RIC.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is
listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is
out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation
of the DUT.

a.  Initiate appropriate action or configuration in the SUT to trigger
    the RIC Subscription Request

Step 4. The Near-RT RIC initiates the RIC Subscription procedure by
sending RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message to the E2 Node, with the agreed
RAN Function Definition IE and measurement information

The E2 Node sends RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE to Near-RT RIC with the list
of admitted and not admitted RAN Actions

The E2 Node sends periodic REPORT RIC INDICATION messages for the agreed
RAN Function Definition with the agreed measurement to the Near-RT RIC
for the requested UE Id

Step 5. The test is ended after the test duration defined in test
entrance criteria, allowing the E2 Node to send several RIC INDICATION
messages to the Near-RT RIC

####### Expected results

The test is considered passed if

1)  All messages are correctly decoded by the protocol analyzer

2)  E2 logs recorded in the protocol analyzer are aligned with
    successful operation message flows specified in \[2\] clause 8.2.
    and consistent with the configuration in E2 Node and Near-RT RIC

3)  RIC Subscription procedure is successful and it is validated in
    recorded E2 logs that\
    - *RAN Function ID* IE corresponds to the agreed RAN Function
    (during E2 Setup procedure) in both RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST and RIC
    SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE messages\
    - *RIC REQUEST ID IE* is the same that in the RIC SUBSCRIPTION
    REQUEST, RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE and RIC INDICATION messages\
    - The *RIC Action ID IE* is the same as that in the RIC SUBSCRIPTION
    REQUEST message in the *RIC Actions Admitted List IE* of the RIC
    SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE message and in the RIC INDICATION message\
    - The *RIC Action Definition IE* in the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST
    message indicates E2SM-KPM Action Definition Format 1 with the
    agreed measurement

4)  Periodicity of the RIC INDICATION messages in the recorded E2 logs
    corresponds with the value of *Reporting Period IE* from *RIC Event
    Trigger Definition IE* of RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message as
    defined in \[5\] clause 8.2.1.1.1

5)  *The Measurement Type* IE in the RIC INDICATION messages is the same
    as that in RIC SUBSCRITPION REQUEST message

6)  Measurements reported by E2 Node in the RIC Indication messages are
    consistent with the traffic simulated by the Test Equipment for the
    specified UE Id

If an Error Indication procedure is triggered during the test, then the
test result shall be determined as failed.

If the agreed *RIC Action ID IE* is present in the *RIC Actions Not
Admitted List IE* of RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE message, then the test
result shall be determined as failed.
