# Foreword

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by WG3 of the O-RAN
Alliance.

The content of the present document is subject to continuing work within
O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN
Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be
re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of version date and an
increase in version number as follows:

version xx.yy.zz

where:

xx: the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance,
i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial
approved document will have xx=01). Always 2 digits with leading zero if
needed.

yy: the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes
have been incorporated in the document. Always 2 digits with leading
zero if needed.

zz: the third digit-group included only in working versions of the
document indicating incremental changes during the editing process.
External versions never include the third digit-group. Always 2 digits
with leading zero if needed.
